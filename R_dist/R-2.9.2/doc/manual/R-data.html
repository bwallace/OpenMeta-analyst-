<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>Reading data into a statistical system for analysis and exporting the
results to some other system for report writing can be frustrating tasks
that can take far more time than the statistical analysis itself, even
though most readers will find the latter far more appealing.

   <p>This manual describes the import and export facilities available either
in R itself or via packages which are available from <acronym>CRAN</acronym>. 
Some of the packages described are still under development but they
already provide useful functionality.

   <p>Unless otherwise stated, everything described in this manual is
available on all platforms running R.

   <p>In general, statistical systems like R are not particularly well
suited to manipulations of large-scale data.  Some other systems are
better than R at this, and part of the thrust of this manual is to
suggest that rather than duplicating functionality in R we can make
another system do the work!  (For example Therneau &amp; Grambsch (2000)
comment that they prefer to do data manipulation in SAS and then use
<strong>survival</strong> in S for the analysis.)  Several recent packages
allow functionality developed in languages such as <code>Java</code>,
<code>perl</code> and <code>python</code> to be directly integrated with R code,
making the use of facilities in these languages even more
appropriate.  (See the <strong>SJava</strong>, <strong>RSPerl</strong> and <strong>RSPython</strong>
packages from the Omegahat project, <a href="http://www.omegahat.org">http://www.omegahat.org</a>, and
the <strong>rJava</strong> package from <acronym>CRAN</acronym>.)

   <p><a name="index-Unix-tools-1"></a><a name="index-AWK-2"></a><a name="index-perl-3"></a>It is also worth remembering that R like S comes from the Unix
tradition of small re-usable tools, and it can be rewarding to use tools
such as <code>awk</code> and <code>perl</code> to manipulate data before import or
after export.  The case study in Becker, Chambers &amp; Wilks (1988, Chapter
9) is an example of this, where Unix tools were used to check and
manipulate the data before input to S.  R itself takes that
approach, using <code>perl</code> to manipulate its databases of help files
rather than R itself, and the function <code>read.fwf</code> used a call to
a <code>perl</code> script until it was decided not to require <code>perl</code> at
run-time.  The traditional Unix tools are now much more widely
available, including on Windows.

<h3 class="section">1.1 Imports</h3>

<p><a name="index-scan-4"></a>
The easiest form of data to import into R is a simple text file, and
this will often be acceptable for problems of small or medium scale. 
The primary function to import from a text file is <code>scan</code>, and this
underlies most of the more convenient functions discussed in
<a href="#Spreadsheet_002dlike-data">Spreadsheet-like data</a>.

   <p>However, all statistical consultants are familiar with being presented
by a client with a floppy disc or CD-R of data in some proprietary
binary format, for example `an Excel spreadsheet' or `an SPSS file'. 
Often the simplest thing to do is to use the originating application to
export the data as a text file (and statistical consultants will have
copies of the most common applications on their computers for that
purpose).  However, this is not always possible, and <a href="#Importing-from-other-statistical-systems">Importing from other statistical systems</a> discusses what facilities are available to
access such files directly from R.  For Excel spreadsheets, the
available methods are summarized in <a href="#Reading-Excel-spreadsheets">Reading Excel spreadsheets</a>.

   <p>In a few cases, data have been stored in a binary form for compactness
and speed of access.  One application of this that we have seen several
times is imaging data, which is normally stored as a stream of bytes as
represented in memory, possibly preceded by a header.  Such data formats
are discussed in <a href="#Binary-files">Binary files</a> and <a href="#Binary-connections">Binary connections</a>.

   <p>For much larger databases it is common to handle the data using a
database management system (DBMS).  There is once again the option of
using the DBMS to extract a plain file, but for many such DBMSs the
extraction operation can be done directly from an R package:
See <a href="#Relational-databases">Relational databases</a>.  Importing data via network connections is
discussed in <a href="#Network-interfaces">Network interfaces</a>.

<h3 class="section">1.2 Export to text files</h3>

<p><a name="index-Exporting-to-a-text-file-5"></a>
Exporting results from R is usually a less contentious task, but
there are still a number of pitfalls.  There will be a target
application in mind, and normally a text file will be the most
convenient interchange vehicle.  (If a binary file is required, see
<a href="#Binary-files">Binary files</a>.)

   <p><a name="index-cat-6"></a>Function <code>cat</code> underlies the functions for exporting data.  It
takes a <code>file</code> argument, and the <code>append</code> argument allows a
text file to be written via successive calls to <code>cat</code>.  Better,
especially if this is to be done many times, is to open a <code>file</code>
connection for writing or appending, and <code>cat</code> to that connection,
then <code>close</code> it.

   <p><a name="index-write-7"></a><a name="index-write_002etable-8"></a>The most common task is to write a matrix or data frame to file as a
rectangular grid of numbers, possibly with row and column labels.  This
can be done by the functions <code>write.table</code> and <code>write</code>. 
Function <code>write</code> just writes out a matrix or vector in a specified
number of columns (and transposes a matrix).  Function
<code>write.table</code> is more convenient, and writes out a data frame (or
an object that can be coerced to a data frame) with row and column
labels.

   <p>There are a number of issues that need to be considered in writing out a
data frame to a text file.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<a name="index-format-9"></a><li><strong>Precision</strong>

     <p>Most of the conversions of real/complex numbers done by these functions
is to full precision, but those by <code>write</code> are governed by the
current setting of <code>options(digits)</code>.  For more control, use
<code>format</code> on a data frame, possibly column-by-column.

     <li><strong>Header line</strong>

     <p>R prefers the header line to have no entry for the row names, so the
file looks like

     <pre class="example">                          dist    climb   time
          Greenmantle     2.5     650     16.083
             ...
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">Some other systems require a (possibly empty) entry for the row names, which
is what <code>write.table</code> will provide if argument <code>col.names = NA</code>
is specified.  Excel is one such system.

     <li><strong>Separator</strong>
<a name="index-CSV-files-10"></a><a name="index-comma-separated-values-11"></a><a name="index-write_002ecsv-12"></a><a name="index-write_002ecsv2-13"></a>
A common field separator to use in the file is a comma, as that is
unlikely to appear in any of the fields, in English-speaking countries. 
Such files are known as CSV (comma separated values) files, and wrapper
function <code>write.csv</code> provides appropriate defaults.  In some locales
the comma is used as the decimal point (set this in <code>write.table</code>
by <code>dec = ","</code>) and there CSV files use the semicolon as the field
separator: use <code>write.csv2</code> for appropriate defaults.

     <p>Using a semicolon or tab (<code>sep = "\t"</code>) are probably the safest
options.

     <li><strong>Missing values</strong>
<a name="index-Missing-values-14"></a>
By default missing values are output as <code>NA</code>, but this may be
changed by argument <code>na</code>.  Note that <code>NaN</code>s are treated as
<code>NA</code> by <code>write.table</code>, but not by <code>cat</code> nor <code>write</code>.

     <li><strong>Quoting strings</strong>
<a name="index-Quoting-strings-15"></a>
By default strings are quoted (including the row and column names). 
Argument <code>quote</code> controls quoting of character and factor variables.

     <p>Some care is needed if the strings contain embedded quotes.  Three
useful forms are

     <pre class="example">          &gt; df &lt;- data.frame(a = I("a \" quote"))
          &gt; write.table(df)
          "a"
          "1" "a \" quote"
          &gt; write.table(df, qmethod = "double")
          "a"
          "1" "a "" quote"
          &gt; write.table(df, quote = FALSE, sep = ",")
          a
          1,a " quote
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">The second is the form of escape commonly used by spreadsheets.
        </ol>

   <p><a name="index-write_002ematrix-16"></a>Function <code>write.matrix</code> in package <strong>MASS</strong> provides a
specialized interface for writing matrices, with the option of writing
them in blocks and thereby reducing memory usage.

   <p><a name="index-sink-17"></a>It is possible to use <code>sink</code> to divert the standard R output to
a file, and thereby capture the output of (possibly implicit)
<code>print</code> statements.  This is not usually the most efficient route,
and the <code>options(width)</code> setting may need to be increased.

   <p><a name="index-write_002eforeign-18"></a>Function <code>write.foreign</code> in package <strong>foreign</strong> uses
<code>write.table</code> to produce a text file and also writes a code file
that will read this text file into another statistical package. There is
currently support for export to <code>SPSS</code> and <code>Stata</code>.

<h3 class="section">1.3 XML</h3>

<p><a name="index-XML-19"></a>
When reading data from text files, it is the responsibility of the user
to know and to specify the conventions used to create that file,
e.g. the comment character, whether a header line is present, the value
separator, the representation for missing values (and so on) described
in <a href="#Export-to-text-files">Export to text files</a>.  A markup language which can be used to
describe not only content but also the structure of the content can
make a file self-describing, so that one need not provide these details
to the software reading the data.

   <p>The eXtensible Markup Language &ndash; more commonly known simply as
<acronym>XML</acronym> &ndash; can be used to provide such structure, not only for
standard datasets but also more complex data structures. 
<acronym>XML</acronym> is becoming extremely popular and is emerging as a
standard for general data markup and exchange.  It is being used by
different communities to describe geographical data such as maps,
graphical displays, mathematics and so on.

   <p>The <strong>XML</strong> package provides general facilities for reading and
writing <acronym>XML</acronym> documents within both R and S-PLUS in the hope
that we can easily make use of this technology as it evolves.  Several
people are exploring how we can use <acronym>XML</acronym> for, amongst other
things, representing datasets to be shared across different
applications; storing R and S-PLUS objects so they can be shared by
both systems; representing plots via <acronym>SVG</acronym> (Scalable Vector
Graphics, a dialect of <acronym>XML</acronym>); representing function
documentation; generating &ldquo;live&rdquo; analyses/reports that contain text,
data and code.

   <p>A description of the facilities of the <strong>XML</strong> package is outside the
scope of this document: see the package's Web page at
<a href="http://www.omegahat.org/RSXML">http://www.omegahat.org/RSXML</a> for details and examples.  Package
<strong>StatDataML</strong> on <acronym>CRAN</acronym> is one example building on <strong>XML</strong>.

<h3 class="section">2.1 Variations on <code>read.table</code></h3>

<p><a name="index-read_002etable-21"></a>
The function <code>read.table</code> is the most convenient way to read in a
rectangular grid of data.  Because of the many possibilities, there are
several other functions that call <code>read.table</code> but change a group
of default arguments.

   <p>Beware that <code>read.table</code> is an inefficient way to read in
very large numerical matrices: see <code>scan</code> below.

   <p>Some of the issues to consider are:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li><strong>Encoding</strong>

     <p>If the file contains non-ASCII character fields, ensure that it is read
in the correct encoding.  This is mainly an issue for reading Latin-1
files in a UTF-8 locale, which can be done by something like

     <pre class="example">          read.table(file("file.dat", encoding="latin1"))
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">Note that this will work in any locale which can represent Latin-1 names.

     <li><strong>Header line</strong>

     <p>We recommend that you specify the <code>header</code> argument explicitly,
Conventionally the header line has entries only for the columns and not
for the row labels, so is one field shorter than the remaining lines. 
(If R sees this, it sets <code>header = TRUE</code>.)  If presented with a
file that has a (possibly empty) header field for the row labels, read
it in by something like

     <pre class="example">          read.table("file.dat", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
     </pre>
     <p>Column names can be given explicitly via the <code>col.names</code>; explicit
names override the header line (if present).

     <li><strong>Separator</strong>

     <p>Normally looking at the file will determine the field separator to be
used, but with white-space separated files there may be a choice between
the default <code>sep = ""</code> which uses any white space (spaces, tabs or
newlines) as a separator, <code>sep = " "</code> and <code>sep = "\t"</code>.  Note
that the choice of separator affects the input of quoted strings.

     <p>If you have a tab-delimited file containing empty fields be sure to use
<code>sep = "\t"</code>.

     <li><strong>Quoting</strong>
<a name="index-Quoting-strings-22"></a>
By default character strings can be quoted by either `<samp><span class="samp">"</span></samp>' or
`<samp><span class="samp">'</span></samp>', and in each case all the characters up to a matching quote are
taken as part of the character string.  The set of valid quoting
characters (which might be none) is controlled by the <code>quote</code>
argument.  For <code>sep = "\n"</code> the default is changed to <code>quote =
""</code>.

     <p>If no separator character is specified, quotes can be escaped within
quoted strings by immediately preceding them by `<samp><span class="samp">\</span></samp>', C-style.

     <p>If a separator character is specified, quotes can be escaped within
quoted strings by doubling them as is conventional in spreadsheets.  For
example

     <pre class="example">          'One string isn''t two',"one more"
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">can be read by

     <pre class="example">          read.table("testfile", sep = ",")
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">This does not work with the default separator.

     <li><strong>Missing values</strong>
<a name="index-Missing-values-23"></a>
By default the file is assumed to contain the character string <code>NA</code>
to represent missing values, but this can be changed by the argument
<code>na.strings</code>, which is a vector of one or more character
representations of missing values.

     <p>Empty fields in numeric columns are also regarded as missing values.

     <p>In numeric columns, the values <code>NaN</code>, <code>Inf</code> and <code>-Inf</code> are
accepted.

     <li><strong>Unfilled lines</strong>

     <p>It is quite common for a file exported from a spreadsheet to have all
trailing empty fields (and their separators) omitted.  To read such
files set <code>fill = TRUE</code>.

     <li><strong>White space in character fields</strong>

     <p>If a separator is specified, leading and trailing white space in
character fields is regarded as part of the field.  To strip the space,
use argument <code>strip.white = TRUE</code>.

     <li><strong>Blank lines</strong>

     <p>By default, <code>read.table</code> ignores empty lines.  This can be changed
by setting <code>blank.lines.skip = FALSE</code>, which will only be useful in
conjunction with <code>fill = TRUE</code>, perhaps to use blank rows to
indicate missing cases in a regular layout.

     <li><strong>Classes for the variables</strong>

     <p>Unless you take any special action, <code>read.table</code> tries to select a
suitable class for each variable in the data frame.  It tries in turn
<code>logical</code>, <code>integer</code>, <code>numeric</code> and <code>complex</code>,
moving on if any entry is not missing and cannot be
converted.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>  If all of these fail, the
variable is converted to a factor.

     <p>Arguments <code>colClasses</code> and <code>as.is</code> provide greater control. 
<code>as.is</code> suppresses conversion of character vectors to factors
(only).  Using <code>colClasses</code> allows the desired class to be set for
each column in the input.

     <p>Note that <code>colClasses</code> and <code>as.is</code> are specified <em>per</em>
column, not <em>per</em> variable, and so include the column of row names
(if any).

     <li><strong>Comments</strong>

     <p>By default, <code>read.table</code> uses `<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>' as a comment character,
and if this is encountered (except in quoted strings) the rest of the
line is ignored. Lines containing only white space and a comment are
treated as blank lines.

     <p>If it is known that there will be no comments in the data file, it is
safer (and may be faster) to use <code>comment.char = ""</code>.

     <li><strong>Escapes</strong>

     <p>Many OSes have conventions for using backslash as an escape character in
text files, but Windows does not (and uses backslash in path names). 
It is optional in R whether such conventions are applied to data files.

     <p>Both <code>read.table</code> and <code>scan</code> have a logical argument
<code>allowEscapes</code>.  As from R 2.2.0 this is false by default, and
backslashes are then only interpreted as (under circumstances described
above) escaping quotes.  If this set to be true, C-style escapes are
interpreted, namely the control characters <code>\a, \b, \f, \n, \r, \t,
\v</code> and octal and hexadecimal representations like <code>\040</code> and
<code>\0x2A</code>.  Any other escaped character is treated as itself,
including backslash.

arguments to <code>read.table</code> appropriate for CSV and tab-delimited
files exported from spreadsheets in English-speaking locales.  The
variations <code>read.csv2</code> and <code>read.delim2</code> are appropriate for
use in countries where the comma is used for the decimal point. 
<!-- Currently R overrides the setting of LC_NUMERIC -->
<!-- You can find the current settings of the computer in use by calling -->
<!-- @code{Sys.localeconv()}. -->

   <p>If the options to <code>read.table</code> are specified incorrectly, the error
message will usually be of the form

<pre class="example">     Error in scan(file = file, what = what, sep = sep, :
             line 1 did not have 5 elements
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or

<pre class="example">     Error in read.table("files.dat", header = TRUE) :
             more columns than column names
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-count_002efields-31"></a>
This may give enough information to find the problem, but the auxiliary
function <code>count.fields</code> can be useful to investigate further.

   <p>Efficiency can be important when reading large data grids.  It will help
to specify <code>comment.char = ""</code>, <code>colClasses</code> as one of the
atomic vector types (logical, integer, numeric, complex, character or
perhaps raw) for each column, and to give <code>nrows</code>, the number of
rows to be read (and a mild over-estimate is better than not specifying
this at all).  See the examples below.

<p><a name="index-Fixed_002dwidth_002dformat-files-32"></a>
Sometimes data files have no field delimiters but have fields in
pre-specified columns.  This was very common in the days of punched
cards, and is still sometimes used to save file space.

   <p><a name="index-read_002efwf-33"></a>Function <code>read.fwf</code> provides a simple way to read such files,
specifying a vector of field widths.  The function reads the file into
memory as whole lines, splits the resulting character strings, writes
out a temporary tab-separated file and then calls <code>read.table</code>. 
This is adequate for small files, but for anything more complicated we
recommend using the facilities of a language like <code>perl</code> to
pre-process the file. 
<a name="index-perl-34"></a>

   <p><a name="index-read_002efortran-35"></a>Function <code>read.fortran</code> is a similar function for fixed-format files,
using Fortran-style column specifications.

<h3 class="section">2.3 Data Interchange Format (DIF)</h3>

<p><a name="index-Data-Interchange-Format-_0028DIF_0029-36"></a>
An old format sometimes used for spreadsheet-like data is DIF, or Data Interchange
format.

   <p><a name="index-read_002eDIF-37"></a>Function <code>read.DIF</code> provides a simple way to read such files.  It takes
arguments similar to <code>read.table</code> for assigning types to each of the columns.

   <p>In Windows, spreadsheets often store spreadsheet data on the clipboard in this
format; <code>read.DIF("clipboard")</code> can read it from there directly. 
It is slightly more robust than <code>read.table("clipboard")</code> in
handling spreadsheets with empty cells.

<h3 class="section">2.4 Using <code>scan</code> directly</h3>

<p><a name="index-scan-38"></a>
Both <code>read.table</code> and <code>read.fwf</code> use <code>scan</code> to read the
file, and then process the results of <code>scan</code>.  They are very
convenient, but sometimes it is better to use <code>scan</code> directly.

   <p>Function <code>scan</code> has many arguments, most of which we have already
covered under <code>read.table</code>.  The most crucial argument is
<code>what</code>, which specifies a list of modes of variables to be read
from the file.  If the list is named, the names are used for the
components of the returned list.  Modes can be numeric, character or
complex, and are usually specified by an example, e.g. <code>0</code>,
<code>""</code> or <code>0i</code>.  For example

<pre class="example">     cat("2 3 5 7", "11 13 17 19", file="ex.dat", sep="\n")
     scan(file="ex.dat", what=list(x=0, y="", z=0), flush=TRUE)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">returns a list with three components and discards the fourth column in
the file.

   <p><a name="index-readLines-39"></a>There is a function <code>readLines</code> which will be more convenient if
all you want is to read whole lines into R for further processing.

   <p>One common use of <code>scan</code> is to read in a large matrix.  Suppose
file <samp><span class="file">matrix.dat</span></samp> just contains the numbers for a 200 x 2000
matrix. Then we can use
<!-- write.table(matrix(rnorm(200*2000), 200), "matrix.dat", row.names=F, col.names=F) -->

<pre class="example">     A &lt;- matrix(scan("matrix.dat", n = 200*2000), 200, 2000, byrow = TRUE)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">On one test this took 1 second (under Linux, 3 seconds under Windows on
the same machine) whereas

<pre class="example">     A &lt;- as.matrix(read.table("matrix.dat"))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">took 10 seconds (and more memory), and

<pre class="example">     A &lt;- as.matrix(read.table("matrix.dat", header = FALSE, nrows = 200,
                               comment.char = "", colClasses = "numeric"))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">took 7 seconds.  The difference is almost entirely due to the overhead
of reading 2000 separate short columns: were they of length 2000,
<code>scan</code> took 9 seconds whereas <code>read.table</code> took 18 if used
efficiently (in particular, specifying <code>colClasses</code>) and 125 if
used naively.

   <p>Note that timings can depend on the type read and the data. 
Consider reading a million distinct integers:
<pre class="example">     writeLines(as.character((1+1e6):2e6), "ints.dat")
     xi &lt;- scan("ints.dat", what=integer(0), n=1e6)   # 0.77s
     xn &lt;- scan("ints.dat", what=numeric(0), n=1e6)   # 0.93s
     xc &lt;- scan("ints.dat", what=character(0), n=1e6) # 0.85s
     xf &lt;- as.factor(xc)                              # 2.2s
     DF &lt;- read.table("ints.dat")                     # 4.5s
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and a million examples of a small set of codes:
<pre class="example">     code &lt;- c("LMH", "SJC", "CHCH", "SPC", "SOM")
     writeLines(sample(code, 1e6, replace=TRUE), "code.dat")
     y &lt;- scan("code.dat", what=character(0), n=1e6)  # 0.44s
     yf &lt;- as.factor(y)                               # 0.21s
     DF &lt;- read.table("code.dat")                     # 4.9s
     DF &lt;- read.table("code.dat", nrows=1e6)          # 3.6s
</pre>
   <p>Note that these timings depend heavily on the operating system (the
basic reads in Windows take at least as twice as long as these Linux
times) and on the precise state of the garbage collector.

Sometimes spreadsheet data is in a compact format that gives the
covariates for each subject followed by all the observations on that
subject.  R's modelling functions need observations in a single

in this example. With <code>direction="wide"</code>, <code>reshape</code> can also
perform the opposite transformation.

<h3 class="section">2.6 Flat contingency tables</h3>

<p><a name="index-Flat-contingency-tables-44"></a>
Displaying higher-dimensional contingency tables in array form typically
is rather inconvenient.  In categorical data analysis, such information
is often represented in the form of bordered two-dimensional arrays with
leading rows and columns specifying the combination of factor levels
corresponding to the cell counts.  These rows and columns are typically
&ldquo;ragged&rdquo; in the sense that labels are only displayed when they change,
with the obvious convention that rows are read from top to bottom and
columns are read from left to right.  In R, such &ldquo;flat&rdquo; contingency
tables can be created using <code>ftable</code>,
<a name="index-ftable-45"></a>which creates objects of class <code>"ftable"</code> with an appropriate print
method.

   <p>As a simple example, consider the R standard data set
<code>UCBAdmissions</code> which is a 3-dimensional contingency table
resulting from classifying applicants to graduate school at UC Berkeley
for the six largest departments in 1973 classified by admission and sex.

<pre class="example">     &gt; data(UCBAdmissions)
     &gt; ftable(UCBAdmissions)
                     Dept   A   B   C   D   E   F
     Admit    Gender
     Admitted Male        512 353 120 138  53  22
              Female       89  17 202 131  94  24
     Rejected Male        313 207 205 279 138 351
              Female       19   8 391 244 299 317
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The printed representation is clearly more useful than displaying the
data as a 3-dimensional array.

   <p>There is also a function <code>read.ftable</code> for reading in flat-like
contingency tables from files. 
<a name="index-read_002eftable-46"></a>This has additional arguments for dealing with variants on how exactly
the information on row and column variables names and levels is
represented.  The help page for <code>read.ftable</code> has some useful
examples.  The flat tables can be converted to standard contingency
tables in array form using <code>as.table</code>.

   <p>Note that flat tables are characterized by their &ldquo;ragged&rdquo; display of
row (and maybe also column) labels.  If the full grid of levels of the
row variables is given, one should instead use <code>read.table</code> to read
in the data, and create the contingency table from this using
<code>xtabs</code>.

<p>The recommended package <strong>foreign</strong> provides import facilities for
files produced by these statistical systems, and for export to Stata. In
some cases these function may require substantially less memory than
<code>read.table</code> would. <code>write.foreign</code> (See <a href="#Export-to-text-files">Export to text files</a>) provides an export mechanism with support currently for <code>SPSS</code> and <code>Stata</code>.

   <p><a name="index-EpiInfo-48"></a><a name="index-EpiData-49"></a><a name="index-read_002eepiinfo-50"></a>EpiInfo versions 5 and 6 stored data in a  self-describing fixed-width
text format. <code>read.epiinfo</code> will read these <samp><span class="file">.REC</span></samp> files into
an R data frame. EpiData also produces data in this format.

   <p><a name="index-Minitab-51"></a><a name="index-read_002emtp-52"></a>Function <code>read.mtp</code> imports a `Minitab Portable Worksheet'.  This
returns the components of the worksheet as an R list.

   <p><a name="index-SAS-53"></a><a name="index-read_002export-54"></a>Function <code>read.xport</code> reads a file in SAS Transport (XPORT) format
and return a list of data frames.  If SAS is available on your system,
function <code>read.ssd</code> can be used to create and run a SAS script that
saves a SAS permanent dataset (<samp><span class="file">.ssd</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">.sas7bdat</span></samp>) in
Transport format.  It then calls <code>read.xport</code> to read the resulting
file.  (Package <strong>Hmisc</strong> has a similar function <code>sas.get</code>, also
running SAS.)  For those without access to SAS but running on Windows,
the SAS System Viewer (a zero-cost download) can be used to open SAS
datasets and export them to e.g. <samp><span class="file">.csv</span></samp> format.

3.x, 4.x or 2000 on (32-bit) Unix or Windows (and can read them on a
different OS).  This is able to read many but not all S objects: in
particular it can read vectors, matrices and data frames and lists
containing those.

   <p>Function <code>data.restore</code> reads S-PLUS data dumps (created by
<code>data.dump</code>) with the same restrictions (except that dumps from the
Alpha platform can also be read).  It should be possible to read data
dumps from S-PLUS 5.x and later written with <code>data.dump(oldStyle=T)</code>.

   <p>If you have access to S-PLUS, it is usually more reliable to <code>dump</code>
the object(s) in S-PLUS and <code>source</code> the dump file in R.  For
S-PLUS 5.x and 6.x you may need to use <code>dump(..., oldStyle=T)</code>, and
to read in very large objects it may be preferable to use the dump file
as a batch script rather than use the <code>source</code> function.

<h3 class="section">4.1 Why use a database?</h3>

<p>There are limitations on the types of data that R handles well. 
Since all data being manipulated by R are resident in memory, and
several copies of the data can be created during execution of a
function, R is not well suited to extremely large data sets.  Data
objects that are more than a (few) hundred megabytes in size can cause
R to run out of memory.

   <p>R does not easily support concurrent access to data.  That is, if
more than one user is accessing, and perhaps updating, the same data,
the changes made by one user will not be visible to the others.

   <p>R does support persistence of data, in that you can save a data
object or an entire worksheet from one session and restore it at the
subsequent session, but the format of the stored data is specific to
R and not easily manipulated by other systems.

   <p>Database management systems (DBMSs) and, in particular, relational
DBMSs (RDBMSs) <em>are</em> designed to do all of these things well. 
Their strengths are

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>To provide fast access to selected parts of large databases.

     <li>Powerful ways to summarize and cross-tabulate columns in databases.

     <li>Store data in more organized ways than the rectangular grid model of
spreadsheets and R data frames.

     <li>Concurrent access from multiple clients running on multiple hosts while
enforcing security constraints on access to the data.

     <li>Ability to act as a server to a wide range of clients.
        </ol>

   <p>The sort of statistical applications for which DBMS might be used are to
extract a 10% sample of the data, to cross-tabulate data to produce a
multi-dimensional contingency table, and to extract data group by group
from a database for separate analysis.

   <p>Increasingly OSes are themselves making use of DBMSs for these reasons,
so it is nowadays likely that one will be already installed on your
(non-Windows) OS.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akonadi">Akonadi</a>
is used by KDE4 to store personal information and uses MySQL.  Several
Mac OS X applications, including Mail and Address Book, use SQLite.

<h3 class="section">4.2 Overview of RDBMSs</h3>

<p>Traditionally there had been large (and expensive) commercial RDBMSs
(<a href="http://www.informix.com">Informix</a>; <a href="http://www.oracle.com">Oracle</a>; <a href="http://www.sybase.com">Sybase</a>;
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/db2">IBM's DB2</a>;
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/SQL/default.mspx">Microsoft <acronym>SQL</acronym> Server</a> on Windows) and academic and small-system databases (such as
MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft Access, <small class="dots">...</small>), the former marked out by
much greater emphasis on data security features.  The line is blurring,
with the Open Source MySQL and PostgreSQL having more and more high-end
features, and free `express' versions being made available for the
commercial DBMSs.

   <p><a name="index-ODBC-70"></a><a name="index-Open-Database-Connectivity-71"></a>There are other commonly used data sources, including spreadsheets,
non-relational databases and even text files (possibly compressed). 
Open Database Connectivity (<acronym>ODBC</acronym>) is a standard to use all of
these data sources.  It originated on Windows (see
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/data/odbc/">http://www.microsoft.com/data/odbc/</a>) but is also implemented on
Linux/Unix.

   <p>All of the packages described later in this chapter provide clients to
client/server databases.  The database can reside on the same machine or
(more often) remotely.  There is an <acronym>ISO</acronym> standard (in fact
several: <acronym>SQL</acronym>92 is <acronym>ISO</acronym>/IEC 9075, also known as
<acronym>ANSI</acronym> X3.135-1992, and <acronym>SQL</acronym>99 is coming into use) for
an interface language called <acronym>SQL</acronym> (Structured Query Language,
sometimes pronounced `sequel': see Bowman <em>et al.</em> 1996 and Kline
and Kline 2001) which these DBMSs support to varying degrees.

<h4 class="subsection">4.2.1 <acronym>SQL</acronym> queries</h4>

<p><a name="index-SQL-queries-72"></a>
The more comprehensive R interfaces generate <acronym>SQL</acronym> behind the
scenes for common operations, but direct use of <acronym>SQL</acronym> is needed
for complex operations in all.  Conventionally <acronym>SQL</acronym> is written
in upper case, but many users will find it more convenient to use lower
case in the R interface functions.

   <p>A relational DBMS stores data as a database of <em>tables</em> (or
<em>relations</em>) which are rather similar to R data frames, in that
they are made up of <em>columns</em> or <em>fields</em> of one type
(numeric, character, date, currency, <small class="dots">...</small>) and <em>rows</em> or
<em>records</em> containing the observations for one entity.

   <p><acronym>SQL</acronym> `queries' are quite general operations on a relational
database.  The classical query is a SELECT statement of the type

<pre class="example">     SELECT State, Murder FROM USArrests WHERE Rape &gt; 30 ORDER BY Murder
     
     SELECT t.sch, c.meanses, t.sex, t.achieve
       FROM student as t, school as c WHERE t.sch = c.id
     
     SELECT sex, COUNT(*) FROM student GROUP BY sex
     
     SELECT sch, AVG(sestat) FROM student GROUP BY sch LIMIT 10
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The first of these selects two columns from the R data frame
<code>USArrests</code> that has been copied across to a database table,
subsets on a third column and asks the results be sorted.  The second
performs a database <em>join</em> on two tables <code>student</code> and
<code>school</code> and returns four columns.  The third and fourth queries do
some cross-tabulation and return counts or averages.  (The five
aggregation functions are COUNT(*) and SUM, MAX, MIN and AVG, each
applied to a single column.)

   <p>SELECT queries use FROM to select the table, WHERE to specify a
condition for inclusion (or more than one condition separated by AND or
OR), and ORDER BY to sort the result.  Unlike data frames, rows in RDBMS
tables are best thought of as unordered, and without an ORDER BY
statement the ordering is indeterminate.  You can sort (in
lexicographical order) on more than one column by separating them by
commas.  Placing DESC after an ORDER BY puts the sort in descending
order.

   <p>SELECT DISTINCT queries will only return one copy of each distinct row
in the selected table.

   <p>The GROUP BY clause selects subgroups of the rows according to the
criterion.  If more than one column is specified (separated by commas)
then multi-way cross-classifications can be summarized by one of the
five aggregation functions.  A HAVING clause allows the select to
include or exclude groups depending on the aggregated value.

   <p>If the SELECT statement contains an ORDER BY statement that produces a
unique ordering, a LIMIT clause can be added to select (by number) a
contiguous block of output rows.  This can be useful to retrieve rows a
block at a time.  (It may not be reliable unless the ordering is unique,
as the LIMIT clause can be used to optimize the query.)

   <p>There are queries to create a table (CREATE TABLE, but usually one
copies a data frame to the database in these interfaces), INSERT or
DELETE or UPDATE data.  A table is destroyed by a DROP TABLE `query'.

   <p>Kline and Kline (2001) discuss the details of the implementation of SQL
in SQL Server 2000, Oracle, MySQL and PostgreSQL.

<h4 class="subsection">4.2.2 Data types</h4>

<p>Data can be stored in a database in various data types.  The range of
data types is DBMS-specific, but the <acronym>SQL</acronym> standard defines many
types, including the following that are widely implemented (often not by
the <acronym>SQL</acronym> name).

     <dl>
<dt><code>float(</code><var>p</var><code>)</code><dd>Real number, with optional precision.  Often called <code>real</code> or
<code>double</code> or <code>double precision</code>. 
<br><dt><code>integer</code><dd>32-bit integer.  Often called <code>int</code>. 
<br><dt><code>smallint</code><dd>16-bit integer
<br><dt><code>character(</code><var>n</var><code>)</code><dd>fixed-length character string.  Often called <code>char</code>. 
<br><dt><code>character varying(</code><var>n</var><code>)</code><dd>variable-length character string.  Often called <code>varchar</code>.  Almost
always has a limit of 255 chars. 
<br><dt><code>boolean</code><dd>true or false.  Sometimes called <code>bool</code> or <code>bit</code>. 
<br><dt><code>date</code><dd>calendar date
<br><dt><code>time</code><dd>time of day
<br><dt><code>timestamp</code><dd>date and time
</dl>

<p class="noindent">There are variants on <code>time</code> and <code>timestamp</code>, <code>with
timezone</code>.  Other types widely implemented are <code>text</code> and
<code>blob</code>, for large blocks of text and binary data, respectively.

   <p>The more comprehensive of the R interface packages hide the type
conversion issues from the user.

<h3 class="section">4.3 R interface packages</h3>

<p>There are several packages available on <acronym>CRAN</acronym> to help R
communicate with DBMSs.  They provide different levels of abstraction. 
Some provide means to copy whole data frames to and from databases.  All
have functions to select data within the database via <acronym>SQL</acronym>
queries, and to retrieve the result as a whole as a
data frame or in pieces (usually as groups of rows).

   <p>All except <strong>RODBC</strong> are tied to one DBMS, but work is in progress
towards a unified `front-end' package <strong>DBI</strong>
(<a href="http://developer.r-project.org/db">http://developer.r-project.org/db</a>) in conjunction with a
`back-end', the most developed of which is <strong>RMySQL</strong>.  Also on
<acronym>CRAN</acronym> are the back-ends <strong>ROracle</strong>, <strong>RPostgreSQL</strong> and
<strong>RSQLite</strong> (which works with the bundled DBMS <code>SQLite</code>,
<a href="http://www.sqlite.org">http://www.sqlite.org</a>).

   <p>Two earlier packages <strong>RmSQL</strong> and <strong>RPgSQL</strong> are now unsupported
and in the archive area on <acronym>CRAN</acronym>: the BioConductor project has updated
<strong>RdbiPgSQL</strong> (formerly on <acronym>CRAN</acronym>).  <strong>PL/R</strong>
(<a href="http://www.joeconway.com/plr/"><code>http://www.joeconway.com/plr/</code></a>) is a project to embed R into
PostgreSQL.

<h4 class="subsection">4.3.1 Packages DBI and  RMySQL</h4>

<p><a name="index-MySQL-database-system-73"></a>
Package <strong>RMySQL</strong> on <acronym>CRAN</acronym> provides an interface to the
MySQL database system (see <a href="http://www.mysql.com">http://www.mysql.com</a> and Dubois,
2000.).  The description here applies to version <code>0.5-0</code>: earlier
versions had a substantially different interface.  The current version
requires the <strong>DBI</strong> package, and this description will apply with
minor changes to all the other back-ends to <strong>DBI</strong>.

   <p>MySQL exists on Unix/Linux and Windows: as from version 3.23.x (Jan 2001)
it is released under GPL.  MySQL is a `light and lean' database.  (It
preserves the case of names where the operating file system is
case-sensitive, so not on Windows.)  Package <strong>RMySQL</strong> has been used
on both Linux and Windows.

   <p><a name="index-dbDriver-74"></a><a name="index-dbConnect-75"></a><a name="index-dbDisconnect-76"></a>The call <code>dbDriver("MySQL")</code> returns a database connection manager
object, and then a call to <code>dbConnect</code> opens a database connection
which can subsequently be closed by a call to the generic function
<code>dbDisconnect</code>.  Use <code>dbDriver("Oracle")</code>,
<code>dbdDriver("PostgreSQL")</code> or <code>dbDriver("SQLite")</code> with those
DBMSs and packages <strong>ROracle</strong>, <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> or <strong>RSQLite</strong>
respectively.

   <p><a name="index-dbSendQuery-77"></a><a name="index-dbClearResult-78"></a><a name="index-dbGetQuery-79"></a><acronym>SQL</acronym> queries can be sent by either <code>dbSendQuery</code> or
<code>dbGetQuery</code>.  <code>dbGetquery</code> sends the query and retrieves the
results as a data frame.  <code>dbSendQuery</code> sends the query and returns
an object of class inheriting from <code>"DBIResult"</code> which can be used
to retrieve the results, and subsequently used in a call to
<code>dbClearResult</code> to remove the result.

   <p><a name="index-fetch-80"></a>Function <code>fetch</code> is used to retrieve some or all of the rows in the
query result, as a list.  The function <code>dbHasCompleted</code> indicates if
all the rows have been fetched, and <code>dbGetRowCount</code> returns the
number of rows in the result.

   <p><a name="index-dbReadTable-81"></a><a name="index-dbWriteTable-82"></a><a name="index-dbExistsTable-83"></a><a name="index-dbRemoveTable-84"></a>These are convenient interfaces to read/write/test/delete tables in the
database.  <code>dbReadTable</code> and <code>dbWriteTable</code> copy to and from
an R data frame, mapping the row names of the data frame to the field
<code>row_names</code> in the <code>MySQL</code> table.

<h4 class="subsection">4.3.2 Package RODBC</h4>

<p><a name="index-ODBC-85"></a><a name="index-Open-Database-Connectivity-86"></a>
Package <strong>RODBC</strong> on <acronym>CRAN</acronym> provides an interface to database
sources supporting an <acronym>ODBC</acronym> interface.  This is very widely
available, and allows the same R code to access different database
systems.  <strong>RODBC</strong> runs on Unix/Linux, Windows and Mac OS X, and
almost all database systems provide support for <acronym>ODBC</acronym>.  We have
tested Microsoft SQL Server, Access, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle and IBM
DB2 on Windows and MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL and SQLite on Linux.

   <p>ODBC is a client-server system, and we have happily connected to a DBMS
running on a Unix server from a Windows client, and <em>vice versa</em>.

   <p>On Windows ODBC support is normally installed, and current versions are
available from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/data/odbc/">http://www.microsoft.com/data/odbc/</a> as part of
MDAC.  On Unix/Linux you will need an <acronym>ODBC</acronym> Driver Manager such
as unixODBC (<a href="http://www.unixODBC.org">http://www.unixODBC.org</a>) or iOBDC
(<a href="http://www.iODBC.org">http://www.iODBC.org</a>: this is pre-installed in Mac OS X) and an
installed driver for your database system.

   <p><a name="index-Excel-87"></a><a name="index-g_t_002exls-88"></a><a name="index-Dbase-89"></a><a name="index-g_t_002edbf-90"></a>Windows provides drivers not just for DBMSs but also for Excel
(<samp><span class="file">.xls</span></samp>) spreadsheets, DBase (<samp><span class="file">.dbf</span></samp>) files and even text
files.  (The named applications do <em>not</em> need to be
installed. Which file formats are supported depends on the the versions
of the drivers.)  There are versions for Excel 2007 and Access 2007 (go
to <a href="http://download.microsoft.com">http://download.microsoft.com</a>, and search for `Office ODBC',
which will lead to <samp><span class="file">AccessDatabaseEngine.exe</span></samp>), the `2007 Office
System Driver'.

   <p>On Mac OS X the Actual Technologies
(<a href="http://www.actualtechnologies.com/product_access.php">http://www.actualtechnologies.com/product_access.php</a>) drivers
provide ODBC interfaces to Access databases (including Access 2007) and
to Excel spreadsheets.

   <p><a name="index-odbcConnect-91"></a><a name="index-odbcDriverConnect-92"></a><a name="index-odbcGetInfo-93"></a>Many simultaneous connections are possible.  A connection is opened by a
call to <code>odbcConnect</code> or <code>odbcDriverConnect</code> (which on the
Windows GUI allows a database to be selected via dialog boxes) which
returns a handle used for subsequent access to the database.  Printing a
connection will provide some details of the ODBC connection, and calling
<code>odbcGetInfo</code> will give details on the client and server.

   <p><a name="index-odbcClose-94"></a><a name="index-close-95"></a>A connection is closed by a call to <code>close</code> or <code>odbcClose</code>,
and also (with a warning) when not R object refers to it and at the end
of an R session.

   <p><a name="index-sqlTables-96"></a>Details of the tables on a connection can be found using
<code>sqlTables</code>.

   <p><a name="index-sqlFetch-97"></a><a name="index-sqlSave-98"></a>Function <code>sqlSave</code> copies an R data frame to a table in the
database, and <code>sqlFetch</code> copies a table in the database to an R
data frame.

   <p><a name="index-sqlQuery-99"></a><a name="index-sqlCopy-100"></a><a name="index-odbcQuery-101"></a><a name="index-sqlGetResults-102"></a><a name="index-sqlFetchMore-103"></a>An <acronym>SQL</acronym> query can be sent to the database by a call to
<code>sqlQuery</code>.  This returns the result in an R data frame. 
(<code>sqlCopy</code> sends a query to the database and saves the result as a
table in the database.)  A finer level of control is attained by first
calling <code>odbcQuery</code> and then <code>sqlGetResults</code> to fetch the
results.  The latter can be used within a loop to retrieve a limited
number of rows at a time, as can function <code>sqlFetchMore</code>.

   <p><a name="index-PostgreSQL-database-system-104"></a>Here is an example using PostgreSQL, for which the <acronym>ODBC</acronym> driver
maps column and data frame names to lower case.  We use a database
<code>testdb</code> we created earlier, and had the DSN (data source name) set
up in <samp><span class="file">~/.odbc.ini</span></samp> under <code>unixODBC</code>.  Exactly the same code
worked using MyODBC to access a MySQL database under Linux or Windows
(where MySQL also maps names to lowercase).  Under Windows,
<acronym>DSN</acronym>s are set up in the <acronym>ODBC</acronym> applet in the Control
Panel (`Data Sources (ODBC)' in the `Administrative Tools' section).

<!-- PostgreSQL is described by its developers as `the most advanced open -->

<!-- @findex db.read.table -->

<!-- To make use of @pkg{RPgSQL}, first open a connection to a database using -->

<!-- time.)  Once a connection is open an @R{} data frame can be copied to a -->
<!-- PostgreSQL table by @code{db.write.table}, whereas @code{db.read.table} -->
<!-- copies a PostgreSQL table to an @R{} data frame. -->
<!-- @findex bind.db.proxy -->
<!-- @cindex proxy data frame -->
<!-- @pkg{RPgSQL} has the interesting concept of a @emph{proxy data frame}. -->
<!-- A data frame proxy is an @R{} object that inherits from the -->
<!-- @code{"data.frame"} class, but contains no data.  All accesses to the -->
<!-- proxy data frame generate the appropriate @acronym{SQL} query and -->
<!-- retrieve the resulting data from the database.  A proxy data frame is -->

<!-- @findex db.result.get.value -->
<!-- A finer level of control is available via sending @acronym{SQL} queries -->
<!-- to the PostgreSQL server via @code{db.execute}.  This leaves a result in -->
<!-- PostgreSQL's result cache, unless flushed by @code{clear = TRUE} (the -->
<!-- default).  Once a result is in the cache, @code{db.fetch.result} can be -->
<!-- used to fetch the whole result as a data frame.  Functions such as -->
<!-- @code{db.result.columns} and @code{db.result.rows} will report the -->
<!-- number of columns and rows in the cached table, and -->
<!-- @code{db.read.column} will fetch a single column (as a vector).  An -->
<!-- individual cell in the result can be read by @code{db.result.get.value}. -->
<!-- @code{db.clear.result} will clear the result cache. -->
<!-- @findex sql.insert -->
<!-- @findex sql.select -->
<!-- One disadvantage is that PostgreSQL maps all table and column names to -->
<!-- lower case, so for maximal flexibility, only use lower case in @R{} -->
<!-- names.  Functions @code{sql.insert} and @code{sql.select} provide -->
<!-- convenience wrappers for the INSERT and SELECT queries. -->

Borland which has a binary flat-file format that became popular, with
file extension <samp><span class="file">.dbf</span></samp>.  It has been adopted for the 'Xbase' family
of databases, covering dBase, Clipper, FoxPro and their Windows
equivalents Visual dBase, Visual Objects and Visual FoxPro (see
<a href="http://www.e-bachmann.dk/docs/xbase.htm">http://www.e-bachmann.dk/docs/xbase.htm</a>).  A dBase file contains
a header and then a series of fields and so is most similar to an R
data frame.  The data itself is stored in text format, and can include
character, logical and numeric fields, and other types in later versions
(see <a href="http://clicketyclick.dk/docs/data_types.html">http://clicketyclick.dk/docs/data_types.html</a>).

<h3 class="section">6.1 Types of connections</h3>

<p><a name="index-Connections-120"></a>
<a name="index-file-121"></a><a name="index-File-connections-122"></a>The most familiar type of connection will be a file, and file
connections are created by function <code>file</code>.  File connections can
(if the OS will allow it for the particular file) be opened for reading
or writing or appending, in text or binary mode.  In fact, files can be
opened for both reading and writing, and R keeps a separate file
position for reading and writing.

   <p><a name="index-open-123"></a><a name="index-close-124"></a>Note that by default a connection is not opened when it is created.  The
rule is that a function using a connection should open a connection
(needed) if the connection is not already open, and close a connection
after use if it opened it.  In brief, leave the connection in the state
you found it in.   There are generic functions <code>open</code> and
<code>close</code> with methods to explicitly open and close connections.

   <p><a name="index-gzfile-125"></a><a name="index-bzfile-126"></a><a name="index-Compressed-files-127"></a>Files compressed via the algorithm used by <code>gzip</code> can be used as
connections created by the function <code>gzfile</code>, whereas files
compressed by <code>bzip2</code> can be used via <code>bzfile</code>.

   <p><a name="index-Terminal-connections-128"></a><a name="index-stdin-129"></a><a name="index-stdout-130"></a><a name="index-stderr-131"></a>Unix programmers are used to dealing with special files <code>stdin</code>,
<code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code>.   These exist as <em>terminal
connections</em> in R.  They may be normal files, but they might also
refer to input from and output to a GUI console.  (Even with the standard
Unix R interface, <code>stdin</code> refers to the lines submitted from
<code>readline</code> rather than a file.)

   <p>The three terminal connections are always open, and cannot be opened or
closed.  <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> are conventionally used for
normal output and error messages respectively.  They may normally go to
the same place, but whereas normal output can be re-directed by a call
to <code>sink</code>, error output is sent to <code>stderr</code> unless re-directed
by <code>sink, type="message")</code>.  Note carefully the language used here:
the connections cannot be re-directed, but output can be sent to other
connections.

   <p><a name="index-Text-connections-132"></a><a name="index-textConnection-133"></a><em>Text connections</em> are another source of input.  They allow R
character vectors to be read as if the lines were being read from a text
file.  A text connection is created and opened by a call to
<code>textConnection</code>, which copies the current contents of the
character vector to an internal buffer at the time of creation.

   <p>Text connections can also be used to capture R output to a character
vector.  <code>textConnection</code> can be asked to create a new character
object or append to an existing one, in both cases in the user's
workspace.  The connection is opened by the call to
<code>textConnection</code>, and at all times the complete lines output to the
connection are available in the R object.  Closing the connection
writes any remaining output to a final element of the character vector.

   <p><a name="index-Pipe-connections-134"></a><a name="index-pipe-135"></a><em>Pipes</em> are a special form of file that connects to another
process, and pipe connections are created by the function <code>pipe</code>. 
Opening a pipe connection for writing (it makes no sense to append to a
pipe) runs an OS command, and connects its standard input to whatever
R then writes to that connection.  Conversely, opening a pipe
connection for input runs an OS command and makes its standard output
available for R input from that connection.

   <p><a name="index-URL-connections-136"></a><a name="index-url-137"></a><acronym>URL</acronym>s of types `<samp><span class="samp">http://</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">ftp://</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">file://</span></samp>'
can be read from using the function <code>url</code>.  For convenience,
<code>file</code> will also accept these as the file specification and call
<code>url</code>.

   <p><a name="index-Sockets-138"></a><a name="index-socketConnection-139"></a>Sockets can also be used as connections via function
<code>socketConnection</code> on platforms which support Berkeley-like sockets
(most Unix systems, Linux and Windows).  Sockets can be written to or
read from, and both client and server sockets can be used.

<h3 class="section">6.2 Output to connections</h3>

<p><a name="index-Connections-140"></a>
<a name="index-cat-141"></a><a name="index-write-142"></a><a name="index-write_002etable-143"></a><a name="index-sink-144"></a>We have described functions <code>cat</code>, <code>write</code>, <code>write.table</code>
and <code>sink</code> as writing to a file, possibly appending to a file if
argument <code>append = TRUE</code>, and this is what they did prior to R
version 1.2.0.

   <p>The current behaviour is equivalent, but what actually happens is that
when the <code>file</code> argument is a character string, a file connection
is opened (for writing or appending) and closed again at the end of the
function call.  If we want to repeatedly write to the same file, it is
more efficient to explicitly declare and open the connection, and pass
the connection object to each call to an output function.  This also
makes it possible to write to pipes, which was implemented earlier in a
limited way via the syntax <code>file = "|cmd"</code> (which can still be
used).

   <p><a name="index-writeLines-145"></a>There is a function <code>writeLines</code> to write complete text lines
to a connection.

   <p>Some simple examples are

<pre class="example">     zz &lt;- file("ex.data", "w")  # open an output file connection
     cat("TITLE extra line", "2 3 5 7", "", "11 13 17",
         file = zz, sep = "\n")
     cat("One more line\n", file = zz)
     close(zz)
     
     ## convert decimal point to comma in output, using a pipe (Unix)
     ## both R strings and (probably) the shell need \ doubled
     zz &lt;- pipe(paste("sed s/\\\\./,/ &gt;", "outfile"), "w")
     cat(format(round(rnorm(100), 4)), sep = "\n", file = zz)
     close(zz)
     ## now look at the output file:
     file.show("outfile", delete.file = TRUE)
     
     ## capture R output: use examples from help(lm)
     zz &lt;- textConnection("ex.lm.out", "w")
     sink(zz)
     example(lm, prompt.echo = "&gt; ")
     sink()
     close(zz)
     ## now `ex.lm.out' contains the output for futher processing.
     ## Look at it by, e.g.,
     cat(ex.lm.out, sep = "\n")

<h3 class="section">6.3 Input from connections</h3>

<p><a name="index-scan-146"></a><a name="index-read_002etable-147"></a><a name="index-readLines-148"></a>The basic functions to read from connections are <code>scan</code> and
<code>readLines</code>.  These take a character string argument and open a
file connection for the duration of the function call, but explicitly
opening a file connection allows a file to be read sequentially in
different formats.

   <p>Other functions that call <code>scan</code> can also make use of connections,
in particular <code>read.table</code>.

   <p>Some simple examples are

<pre class="example">     ## read in file created in last examples
     readLines("ex.data")
     unlink("ex.data")
     
     ## read listing of current directory (Unix)
     readLines(pipe("ls -1"))
     
     # remove trailing commas from an input file.
     # Suppose we are given a file `data' containing
     450, 390, 467, 654,  30, 542, 334, 432, 421,
     357, 497, 493, 550, 549, 467, 575, 578, 342,
     446, 547, 534, 495, 979, 479
     # Then read this by
     scan(pipe("sed -e s/,$// data"), sep=",")
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-URL-connections-149"></a>For convenience, if the <code>file</code> argument specifies a FTP or HTTP
<acronym>URL</acronym>, the <acronym>URL</acronym> is opened for reading via <code>url</code>. 
Specifying files via `<samp><span class="samp">file://foo.bar</span></samp>' is also allowed.

<h4 class="subsection">6.3.1 Pushback</h4>

<p><a name="index-pushBack_002e-150"></a><a name="index-Pushback-on-a-connection-151"></a>C programmers may be familiar with the <code>ungetc</code> function to push
back a character onto a text input stream.  R connections have the
same idea in a more powerful way, in that an (essentially) arbitrary
number of lines of text can be pushed back onto a connection via a call
to <code>pushBack</code>.

   <p>Pushbacks operate as a stack, so a read request first uses each line
from the most recently pushbacked text, then those from earlier
pushbacks and finally reads from the connection itself.  Once a
pushbacked line is read completely, it is cleared.  The number of
pending lines pushed back can be found via a call to
<code>pushBackLength</code>. 
<a name="index-pushBackLength-152"></a>
A simple example will show the idea.

<pre class="example">     &gt; zz &lt;- textConnection(LETTERS)
     &gt; readLines(zz, 2)
     [1] "A" "B"
     &gt; scan(zz, "", 4)
     Read 4 items
     [1] "C" "D" "E" "F"
     &gt; pushBack(c("aa", "bb"), zz)
     &gt; scan(zz, "", 4)
     Read 4 items
     [1] "aa" "bb" "G"  "H"
     &gt; close(zz)
</pre>
   <p>Pushback is only available for connections opened for input in text mode.

   <p><a name="index-seek-155"></a><a name="index-isSeekable-156"></a>The generic function <code>seek</code> can be used to read and (on some
connections) reset the current position for reading or writing. 
Unfortunately it depends on OS facilities which may be unreliable
(e.g. with text files under Windows).  Function <code>isSeekable</code>
reports if <code>seek</code> can change the position on the connection
given by its argument.

   <p><a name="index-truncate-157"></a>The function <code>truncate</code> can be used to truncate a file opened for

<h3 class="section">6.5 Binary connections</h3>

<p><a name="index-Binary-files-158"></a>
<a name="index-readBin-159"></a><a name="index-writeBin-160"></a>Functions <code>readBin</code> and <code>writeBin</code> read to and write from
binary connections.  A connection is opened in binary mode by appending
<code>"b"</code> to the mode specification, that is using mode <code>"rb"</code> for
reading, and mode <code>"wb"</code> or <code>"ab"</code> (where appropriate) for
writing.  The functions have arguments

<pre class="example">     readBin(con, what, n = 1, size = NA, endian = .Platform$endian)
     writeBin(object, con, size = NA, endian = .Platform$endian)
</pre>
   <p>In each case <code>con</code> is a connection which will be opened if
necessary for the duration of the call, and if a character string is
given it is assumed to specify a file name.

   <p>It is slightly simpler to describe writing, so we will do that first. 
<code>object</code> should be an atomic vector object, that is a vector of
mode <code>numeric</code>, <code>integer</code>, <code>logical</code>, <code>character</code>,
<code>complex</code> or <code>raw</code>, without attributes.  By default this is
written to the file as a stream of bytes exactly as it is represented in
memory.

   <p><code>readBin</code> reads a stream of bytes from the file and interprets them
as a vector of mode given by <code>what</code>.  This can be either an object
of the appropriate mode (e.g. <code>what=integer()</code>) or a character
string describing the mode (one of the five given in the previous
paragraph or <code>"double"</code> or <code>"int"</code>).  Argument <code>n</code>
specifies the maximum number of vector elements to read from the
connection: if fewer are available a shorter vector will be returned. 
Argument <code>signed</code> allows 1-byte and 2-byte integers to be
read as signed (the default) or unsigned integers.

   <p>The remaining two arguments are used to write or read data for
interchange with another program or another platform.  By default binary
data is transferred directly from memory to the connection or <em>vice
versa</em>.  This will not suffice if the file is to be transferred to a
machine with a different architecture, but between almost all R
platforms the only change needed is that of byte-order.  Common PCs
(`<samp><span class="samp">ix86</span></samp>'-based and `<samp><span class="samp">x86_64</span></samp>'-based machines), Compaq Alpha
and Vaxen are <em>little-endian</em>, whereas Sun Sparc, mc680x0 series,
IBM R6000, Apple Macintosh, SGI and most others are <em>big-endian</em>. 
(Network byte-order (as used by XDR, eXternal Data Representation) is
big-endian.)  To transfer to or from other programs we may need to do
more, for example to read 16-bit integers or write single-precision real
numbers.  This can be done using the <code>size</code> argument, which
(usually) allows sizes 1, 2, 4, 8 for integers and logicals, and sizes
4, 8 and perhaps 12 or 16 for reals.  Transferring at different sizes
can lose precision, and should not be attempted for vectors containing
<code>NA</code>'s.

   <p><a name="index-readChar-161"></a><a name="index-writeChar-162"></a>Character strings are read and written in C format, that is as a string
of bytes terminated by a zero byte.  Functions <code>readChar</code> and
<code>writeChar</code> provide greater flexibility.

<h4 class="subsection">6.5.1 Special values</h4>

<p>Functions <code>readBin</code> and <code>writeBin</code> will pass missing and
special values, although this should not be attempted if a size change
is involved.

   <p>The missing value for R logical and integer types is <code>INT_MIN</code>,
the smallest representable <code>int</code> defined in the C header
<samp><span class="file">limits.h</span></samp>, normally corresponding to the bit pattern
<code>0x80000000</code>.

   <p>The representation of the special values for R numeric and complex
types is machine-dependent, and possibly also compiler-dependent.  The
simplest way to make use of them is to link an external application
against the standalone <code>Rmath</code> library which exports double
constants <code>NA_REAL</code>, <code>R_PosInf</code> and <code>R_NegInf</code>, and
include the header <samp><span class="file">Rmath.h</span></samp> which defines the macros <code>ISNAN</code>
and <code>R_FINITE</code>.

   <p>If that is not possible, on all common platforms IEC 60559 (aka IEEE
754) arithmetic is used, so standard C facilities can be used to test
for or set <code>Inf</code>, <code>-Inf</code> and <code>NaN</code> values.  On such
platforms <code>NA</code> is represented by the <code>NaN</code> value with low-word
<code>0x7a2</code> (1954 in decimal).

   <p>Character missing values are written as <code>NA</code>, and there are no
provision to recognize character values as missing (as this can be done
by re-assigning them once read).

<h3 class="section">7.1 Reading from sockets</h3>

<p><a name="index-Sockets-163"></a>Base R comes with some facilities to communicate <em>via</em>
<acronym>BSD</acronym> sockets on systems that support them (including the common
Linux, Unix and Windows ports of R).  One potential problem with
using sockets is that these facilities are often blocked for security
reasons or to force the use of Web caches, so these functions may be
more useful on an intranet than externally.  For new projects it
is suggested that socket connections are used instead.

<code>read.socket</code>, <code>write.socket</code> and <code>close.socket</code>.

<p>Function <code>download.file</code> is provided to read a file from a
Web resource via FTP or HTTP and write it to a file.  Often this can be
avoided, as functions such as <code>read.table</code> and <code>scan</code> can read
directly from a URL, either by explicitly using <code>url</code> to open a
connection, or implicitly using it by giving a URL as the <code>file</code>
argument.

<h3 class="section">7.3 <acronym>DCOM</acronym> interface</h3>

<p><a name="index-DCOM-168"></a>
<acronym>DCOM</acronym> is a Windows protocol for communicating between different
programs, possibly on different machines.  Thomas Baier's
<code>StatConnector</code> program available from <acronym>CRAN</acronym> under
Software-&gt;Other-&gt;Non-standard provides an interface to the proxy DLL in
package <strong>rscproxy</strong> and makes an <acronym>DCOM</acronym> server.  This can be
used to pass simple objects (vectors and matrices) to and from R and
to submit commands to R.  (It is not clear if this is still
functional: there is another version in the <strong>RExcelInstaller</strong> package.)

   <p>The program comes with a Visual Basic demonstration and an Excel plug-in
by Erich Neuwirth available.  This interface is in the other direction
to most of those considered here in that it is another application
(Excel, or written in Visual Basic) that is the client and R is the
server.

   <p>Another (D)COM server is available from <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/">http://www.omegahat.org/</a>,
which allows R objects to be exported as COM values.  That site also
has packages <code>RDCOMClient</code> and <code>SWinTypeLibs</code> which allow R
to act as a (D)COM client.

<h3 class="section">7.4 <acronym>CORBA</acronym> interface</h3>

<p><a name="index-CORBA-169"></a>
<acronym>CORBA</acronym> (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) is similar
to <acronym>DCOM</acronym>, allowing applications to call methods, or operations,
in server objects running in other applications, potentially programmed
in different languages and running on different machines.  There is a
<strong>CORBA</strong> package available from the Omegahat project (at
<a href="http://www.omegahat.org/RSCORBA/">http://www.omegahat.org/RSCORBA/</a>), currently for Unix but a
Windows version looks to be possible.

   <p>This package allows R commands to be used to locate available
<acronym>CORBA</acronym> servers, query the methods they provide, and dynamically
invoke methods on these objects.  R values given as arguments in
these calls are exported in the call and made available to that
operation invocation.  Primitive data types (vectors and lists) are
exported by default, while more complex objects are exported by
reference.  Examples of using this include communicating with the
Gnumeric (<a href="http://www.gnumeric.org">http://www.gnumeric.org</a>) spreadsheet, and also
interacting with the data visualization system
<a href="http://www.ggobi.org">ggobi</a>.

   <p>One can also create <acronym>CORBA</acronym> servers within R, allowing other
applications to call these methods.  For example, one might offer access
to a particular dataset or to some of R's modelling software.  This
is done dynamically by combining R data objects and functions.  This
allows one to explicitly export data and functionality from R.

   <p>One can also use the <strong>CORBA</strong> package to achieve distributed,
parallel computing in R.  One R session acts as a manager and
dispatches tasks to different servers running in other R worker
sessions.  This uses the ability to invoke asynchronous or background
CORBA calls in R.  More information is available from the Omegahat
project at <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/RSCORBA/">http://www.omegahat.org/RSCORBA/</a>.

<h2 class="chapter">8 Reading Excel spreadsheets</h2>

<p>The most common R data import/export question seems to be `how do I read
an Excel spreadsheet'.  This chapter collects together advice and
options given earlier.  Note that most of the advice is for pre-Excel
2007 spreadsheets: currently the only one of these methods that reads
the <samp><span class="file">.xlsx</span></samp> format is that <em>via</em> <strong>RODBC</strong>.

   <p><a name="index-read_002ecsv-170"></a><a name="index-read_002edelim-171"></a><a name="index-read_002eDIF-172"></a><a name="index-read_002etable-173"></a><a name="index-readClipboard-174"></a>The first piece of advice is to avoid doing so if possible!  If you have
access to Excel, export the data you want from Excel in tab-delimited or
comma-separated form, and use <code>read.delim</code> or <code>read.csv</code> to
import it into R.  (You may need to use <code>read.delim2</code> or
<code>read.csv2</code> in a continental European locale that uses comma as the
decimal point.)  Exporting a DIF file and reading it using
<code>read.DIF</code> is another possibility.

   <p>If you do not have Excel, many other programs are able to read such
spreadsheets and export in a text format on both Windows and Unix, for
example Gnumeric (<a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnumeric/">http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnumeric/</a>) and
OpenOffice (<a href="http://www.openoffice.org">http://www.openoffice.org</a>).  You can also
cut-and-paste between the display of a spreadsheet in such a program and
R: <code>read.table</code> will read from the R console or, under Windows,
from the clipboard (via <code>file = "clipboard"</code> or
<code>readClipboard</code>).  The <code>read.DIF</code> function can also read from
the clipboard.

   <p>Note that an Excel <samp><span class="file">.xls</span></samp> file is not just a spreadsheet: such
files can contain many sheets, and the sheets can contain formulae,
macros and so on.  Not all readers can read other than the first sheet,
and may be confused by other contents of the file.

   <p><a name="index-odbcConnectExcel-175"></a><a name="index-odbcConnectExcel2007-176"></a>Windows users can use <code>odbcConnectExcel</code> in package <strong>RODBC</strong>. 
This can select rows and columns from any of the sheets in an Excel
spreadsheet file (at least from Excel 97&ndash;2003, depending on your ODBC
drivers: by calling <code>odbcConnect</code> directly versions back to Excel
3.0 can be read).  The version <code>odbcConnectExcel2007</code> will read the
Excel 2007 formats as well as earlier ones (provided the drivers are
installed: see <a href="#RODBC">RODBC</a>).  Mac users can also use <strong>RODBC</strong> if they
have a suitable driver (e.g. that from Actual Technologies).

   <p><a name="index-read_002exls-177"></a><code>Perl</code> users have contributed a module
<code>OLE::SpreadSheet::ParseExcel</code> And a program <code>xls2csv.pl</code> to
convert Excel 95&ndash;2003 spreadsheets to CSV files.  Package <strong>gdata</strong>
provides a basic wrapper in its <code>read.xls</code> function.

   <p><a name="index-xlsReadWrite-178"></a>Windows-only package <strong>xlsReadWrite</strong> from
<a href="http://treetron.googlepages.com/">http://treetron.googlepages.com/</a> has a function <code>read.xls</code>
to read <samp><span class="file">.xls</span></samp> files (based on a third-party non-Open Source Delphi
component).

   <p><a name="index-dataframes2xls-179"></a><a name="index-WriteXLS-180"></a>Packages <strong>dataframes2xls</strong> and <strong>WriteXLS</strong> each contain a function
to <em>write</em> one or more data frames to an <samp><span class="file">.xls</span></samp> file:, using
Python and Perl respectively.  Another version of <code>write.xls</code> in
available in package <strong>xlsReadWrite</strong>.
