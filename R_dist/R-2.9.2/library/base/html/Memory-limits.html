<h2>Memory Limits in R</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
<font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> holds objects it is using in memory.  This help file documents the
current design limitations on large objects: these differ between
32-bit and 64-bit builds of <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
<font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> holds all objects in memory, and there are limits based on the
amount of memory that can be used by all objects:
<ul>
<li>There may be limits on the size of the heap and the number of
cons cells allowed &ndash; see <code><a href="Memory.html">Memory</a></code> &ndash; but these are
usually not imposed.
<li>There is a limit on the address space of a single process such
as the <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> executable.  This is 2Gb under 32-bit Windows unless
the OS's default has been changed to allow more (up to 3Gb).
See
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/platform/server/PAE/PAEmem.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/platform/server/PAE/PAEmem.mspx</a>
and <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa366778.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa366778.aspx</a>.
(Under some 64-bit versions of Windows the limit is 4Gb: for others
it is 2Gb.)
<li>Under Windows, <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> does impose limits on the total memory
allocation available to a single run, as the OS provides no way to
do so.  See <code><a href="../../utils/html/memory.size.html">memory.size</a></code> and <code><a href="../../utils/html/memory.size.html">memory.limit</a></code>.
</ul>
<p>
Error messages beginning <code>cannot allocate vector of size</code>
indicate a failure to obtain memory, either because the size exceeded
the address-space limit for a process or, more likely, because the
system was unable to provide the memory.  Note that on a 32-bit OS
there may well be enough free memory available, but not a large enough
contiguous block of address space into which to map it.
</p>
<p>
There are also limits on individual objects.  On all versions of <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>,
the maximum length (number of elements) of a vector is
<i>2^31 - 1 ~ 2*10^9</i>, as
lengths are stored as signed integers.  In addition, the storage space
cannot exceed the address limit, and if you try to exceed that limit,
the error message begins <code>cannot allocate vector of length</code>.
The number of characters in a character string is in theory only
limited by the address space.
