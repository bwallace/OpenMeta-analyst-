<h2>Test Objects for Exact Equality</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
The safe and reliable way to test two objects for being
<EM>exactly</EM> equal.  It returns <code>TRUE</code> in this case,
<code>FALSE</code> in every other case.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
identical(x, y)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x, y</code></td>
<td>
any <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> objects.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
A call to <code>identical</code> is the way to test exact equality in
<code>if</code> and <code>while</code> statements, as well as in logical
expressions that use <code>&amp;&amp;</code> or <code>||</code>.  In all these
applications you need to be assured of getting a single logical
value.
</p>
<p>
Users often use the comparison operators, such as <code>==</code> or
<code>!=</code>, in these situations.  It looks natural, but it is not what
these operators are designed to do in R.  They return an object like
the arguments.  If you expected <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> to be of length
1, but it happened that one of them wasn't, you will <EM>not</EM> get a
single <code>FALSE</code>.  Similarly, if one of the arguments is <code>NA</code>,
the result is also <code>NA</code>.  In either case, the expression
<code>if(x == y)....</code> won't work as expected.
</p>
<p>
The function <code>all.equal</code> is also sometimes used to test equality
this way, but was intended for something different:  it allows for
small differences in numeric results.
</p>
<p>
The computations in <code>identical</code> are also reliable and usually
fast.  There should never be an error.  The only known way to kill
<code>identical</code> is by having an invalid pointer at the C level,
generating a memory fault.  It will usually find inequality quickly.
Checking equality for two large, complicated objects can take longer
if the objects are identical or nearly so, but represent completely
independent copies.  For most applications, however, the computational cost
should be negligible.
</p>
<p>
<code>identical</code> sees <code><a href="is.finite.html">NaN</a></code> as different from
<code><a href="NA.html">NA_real_</a></code>, but all <code>NaN</code>s are equal (and all <code>NA</code>
of the same type are equal).
</p>
<p>
Comparison of attributes view them as a set (and not a vector, so
order is not tested).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
A single logical value, <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code>, never <code>NA</code>
and never anything other than a single value.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
identical(1, NULL) ## FALSE -- don't try this with ==
identical(1, 1.)   ## TRUE in R (both are stored as doubles)
identical(1, as.integer(1)) ## FALSE, stored as different types

x &lt;- 1.0; y &lt;- 0.99999999999
## how to test for object equality allowing for numeric fuzz :
(E &lt;- all.equal(x,y))
isTRUE(E) # which is simply defined to just use
identical(TRUE, E)
## If all.equal thinks the objects are different, it returns a
## character string, and the above expression evaluates to FALSE

# even for unusual R objects :
identical(.GlobalEnv, environment())
