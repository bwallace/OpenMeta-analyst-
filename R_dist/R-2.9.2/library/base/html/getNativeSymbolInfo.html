<h2>Obtain a Description of one or more Native (C/Fortran) Symbols</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
This finds and returns as comprehensive a description of one or more
dynamically loaded or &lsquo;exported&rsquo; built-in native symbols.  For
each name, it returns information about the name of the symbol, the
library in which it is located and, if available, the number of
arguments it expects and by which interface it should be called (i.e
<code><a href="Foreign.html">.Call</a></code>, <code><a href="Foreign.html">.C</a></code>, <code><a href="Foreign.html">.Fortran</a></code>, or
<code><a href="Foreign.html">.External</a></code>). Additionally, it returns the address of the
symbol and this can be passed to other C routines which can
invoke. Specifically, this provides a way to explicitly share symbols
between different dynamically loaded package libraries. Also, it
provides a way to query where symbols were resolved, and aids
diagnosing strange behavior associated with dynamic resolution.
</p>
<p>
This is vectorized in the <code>name</code> argument so can process
multiple symbols in a single call.  The result is a list that can be
indexed by the given symbol names.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
getNativeSymbolInfo(name, PACKAGE, unlist = TRUE,
                    withRegistrationInfo = FALSE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>name</code></td>
<td>
the name(s) of the native symbol(s) as used in a call
to <code><a href="dynload.html">is.loaded</a></code>, etc.  Note that Fortran symbols should be
supplied as-is, not wrapped in <code>symbol.For</code>.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>PACKAGE</code></td>
<td>
an optional argument that specifies to which
DLL we restrict the search for this symbol.  If this is
<code>"base"</code>, we search in the <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> executable itself.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>unlist</code></td>
<td>
a logical value which controls how the result is
returned if the function is called with the name of a single symbol.
If <code>unlist</code> is <code>TRUE</code> and the number of symbol names in
<code>name</code> is one, then the <code>NativeSymbolInfo</code> object
is returned.  If it is <code>FALSE</code>, then a list
of <code>NativeSymbolInfo</code> objects is returned.
This is ignored if the number of symbols passed in <code>name</code> is
more than one. 
To be compatible with earlier versions of this function, this
defaults to <code>TRUE</code>.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>withRegistrationInfo</code></td>
<td>
a logical value indicating whether, if
<code>TRUE</code>, to return information that was registered with <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> about
the symbol and its parameter types if such information is available,
or if <code>FALSE</code> to return the address of the symbol.
</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
This uses the same mechanism for resolving symbols as is used
in all the native interfaces (<code><a href="Foreign.html">.Call</a></code>, etc.).
If the symbol has been explicitly registered by the DLL
in which it is contained, information about the number of arguments
and the interface by which it should be called will be returned.
Otherwise, a generic native symbol object is returned.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
Generally, a list of <code>NativeSymbolInfo</code> elements whose elements
can be indexed by the elements of <code>name</code>  in the call.  Each
<code>NativeSymbolInfo</code> object is a list containing the following
elements:
</p>
<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>name</code></td>
<td>
the name of the symbol, as given by the
<code>name</code> argument.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>address</code></td>
<td>
if <code>withRegistrationInfo</code> is <code>FALSE</code>,
this is the native memory address of the symbol which can
be used to invoke the routine, and also to
compare with other symbol addresses.  This is an external pointer
object and of class <code>NativeSymbol</code>.
If <code>withRegistrationInfo</code> is <code>TRUE</code> and registration
information is available for the symbol, then this is
an object of class <code>RegisteredNativeSymbol</code> and is a reference
to an internal data type that has access to the routine pointer and
registration information. This too can be used in calls to
<code><a href="Foreign.html">.Call</a></code>, <code><a href="Foreign.html">.C</a></code>, <code><a href="Foreign.html">.Fortran</a></code> and
<code><a href="Foreign.html">.External</a></code>.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>package</code></td>
<td>
a list containing 3 elements:
<dl>
<dt>name</dt><dd>the short form of the library name which can be used
as the value of the <code>PACKAGE</code> argument in
the different native interface functions.</dd>
<dt>path</dt><dd>the fully qualified name of the DLL.</dd>
<dt>dynamicLookup</dt><dd>a logical value indicating whether dynamic
resolution is used when looking for symbols in this library,
or only registered routines can be located.</dd>
</dl>    
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>numParameters</code></td>
<td>
the number of arguments that should be passed in
a call to this routine.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>

Additionally, the list will have an additional class,
being <code>CRoutine</code>, <code>CallRoutine</code>, <code>FortranRoutine</code> or
<code>ExternalRoutine</code> corresponding to the R interface by which it
should be invoked.
<br>
If any of the symbols is not found, an error is immediately raised.
<br>
If <code>name</code> contains only one symbol name and <code>unlist</code> is
<code>TRUE</code>, then the single <code>NativeSymbolInfo</code> is returned
rather than the list containing that one element.</p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>
One motivation for accessing this reflectance information is to be
able to pass native routines to C routines as function pointers in C.
This allows us to treat native routines and <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> functions in a similar
manner, such as when passing an <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> function to C code that makes
callbacks to that function at different points in its computation
(e.g., <code><a href="../../stats/html/nls.html">nls</a></code>).  Additionally, we can resolve the symbol
just once and avoid resolving it repeatedly or using the internal
cache.  In the future, one may be able to treat <code>NativeSymbol</code>
objects directly as callback objects.
