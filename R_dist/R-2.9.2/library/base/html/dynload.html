<h2>Foreign Function Interface</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Load or unload DLLs (also known as shared objects), and test whether a
C function or Fortran subroutine is available.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
dyn.load(x, local = TRUE, now = TRUE, ...)
dyn.unload(x)

is.loaded(symbol, PACKAGE = "", type = "")
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
a character string giving the pathname to a DLL, also known
as a dynamic shared object. (See &lsquo;Details&rsquo; for what these
terms mean.)</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>local</code></td>
<td>
a logical value controlling whether the symbols in the
DLL are stored in their own local table and not shared
across DLLs, or added to the global symbol table.  Whether this has
any effect is system-dependent.
It is ignored on Windows.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>now</code></td>
<td>
a logical controlling whether all symbols are resolved (and
relocated) immediately the library is loaded or deferred until they
are used.  This control is useful for developers testing whether a
library is complete and has all the necessary symbols, and for users
to ignore missing symbols. Whether this has any effect is system-dependent.
It is ignored on Windows.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
other arguments for future expansion.
See section &lsquo;Windows&rsquo; below.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>symbol</code></td>
<td>
a character string giving a symbol name.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>PACKAGE</code></td>
<td>
if supplied, confine the search for the <code>name</code> to
the DLL given by this argument (plus the conventional extension,
&lsquo;<span class="file">.so</span>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<span class="file">.sl</span>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<span class="file">.dll</span>&rsquo;, ...).  This is intended to
add safety for packages, which can ensure by using this argument
that no other package can override their external symbols.  Use
<code>PACKAGE="base"</code> for symbols linked in to <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>.  This is used in the
same way as in <code><a href="Foreign.html">.C</a></code>, <code><a href="Foreign.html">.Call</a></code>,
<code><a href="Foreign.html">.Fortran</a></code> and <code><a href="Foreign.html">.External</a></code> functions</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
The type of symbol to look for: can be any (<code>""</code>, the
default), <code>"Fortran"</code>, <code>"Call"</code> or <code>"External"</code>.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
The objects <code>dyn.load</code> loads are called &lsquo;dynamically
loadable libraries&rsquo; (abbreviated to &lsquo;DLL&rsquo; on all platforms
except Mac OS X, which unfortunately uses the term for a different
sort of sobject.  On Unix-alikes they are also called &lsquo;dynamic
shared objects&rsquo; (&lsquo;DSO&rsquo;), or &lsquo;shared objects&rsquo; for
short.  (The POSIX standards use &lsquo;executable object file&rsquo;, but
no one else does.)
</p>
<p>
See &lsquo;See Also&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Writing R Extensions&rsquo; and
&lsquo;R Installation and Administration&rsquo; manuals for how to create
and install a suitable DLL.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately a very few platforms (e.g. Compaq Tru64) do not handle
the <code>PACKAGE</code> argument correctly, and may incorrectly find
symbols linked into <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>.
</p>
<p>
The additional arguments to <code>dyn.load</code> mirror the different
aspects of the mode argument to the <code>dlopen()</code> routine on POSIX
systems. They are available so that users can exercise greater control
over the loading process for an individual library.  In general, the
default values are appropriate and you should override them only if
there is good reason and you understand the implications.
</p>
<p>
External code must not change the floating point control word, but
many DLLs do so.  Common changes are to set it to use 53 bit
precision instead of R's default 64 bit precision, or to unmask
some exceptions.  <code>dyn.load</code> detects such changes,
and restores R's control word to its default value of hex 8001F.
This may cause the DLL to malfunction; if so, it should be rewritten
to save and restore the control word itself.  If <code>warn.FPU</code>
is set to <code>TRUE</code> using the <code><a href="options.html">options</a></code> function,
a warning will be printed.  (If the warning says
that the control word was changed from some other value than 8001F,
please report the circumstances to the Windows maintainers:
that probably indicates an internal bug.)
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
The function <code>dyn.load</code> is used for its side effect which links
the specified DLL to the executing <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> image.  Calls to <code>.C</code>,
<code>.Call</code>, <code>.Fortran</code> and <code>.External</code> can then be used to
execute compiled C functions or Fortran subroutines contained in the
library.  The return value of <code>dyn.load</code> is an object of class
<code>DLLInfo</code>.  See <code><a href="getLoadedDLLs.html">getLoadedDLLs</a></code> for information about
this class.
<br>
The function <code>dyn.unload</code> unlinks the DLL.  Note that unloading a
DLL and then re-loading a DLL of the same name may or may not work: on
Solaris it uses the first version loaded.
<br>
<code>is.loaded</code> checks if the symbol name is loaded and hence
available for use in <code>.C</code> or <code>.Fortran</code> or <code>.Call</code> or
<code>.External</code>.  It will succeed if any one of the four calling
functions would succeed in using the entry point unless <code>type</code> is
specified.  (See <code><a href="Foreign.html">.Fortran</a></code> for how Fortran symbols are
mapped.)</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>
The &lsquo;standard mechanisms for loading DLLs&rsquo; include a
search order for where a DLL is found (if not given as an absolute
path, which is preferred), <EM>and</EM> of where its dependent DLLs will
be found.  This search path depends on the version of Windows and its
security settings, but for versions since Windows XP SP1 it is
<ul>
<li>The directory from which the application was launched.
<li>The various system directories,
e.g. &lsquo;<span class="file">c:/Windows/system32</span>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<span class="file">c:/Windows/system</span>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<span class="file">c:/Windows</span>&rsquo;.
<li>The current directory.
<li>Along the search path for executables given by the environment
variable <span class="env">PATH</span>.
</ul>

<p>
Packages often want to supply dependent DLLs in their &lsquo;<span class="file">libs</span>&rsquo;
directory, and do this by setting the <span class="env">PATH</span> variable
(<code><a href="library.dynam.html">library.dynam</a></code> does that automatically in recent
versions of <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>), but the DLL search order means that DLLs in the
launch directory and in system directories will be preferred.  On
Windows XP SP1 and later there is a way to modify the search order.
If argument <code>DLLpath</code> is supplied to <code>dyn.load</code>, the latter
makes use of the Windows system call <code>SetDllDirectory</code> to insert
the value of <code>DLLpath</code> in second place, and removes the current
directory, for the duration of that <code>dyn.load</code> call.  (Note that
only one directory can be inserted in this way.)  On Windows 2000, the
second item in the search order is the current directory, and the
current directory is changed temporarily to implement <code>DLLpath</code>.
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>
Do not use <code>dyn.unload</code> on a DLL loaded by
<code><a href="library.dynam.html">library.dynam</a></code>: use <code><a href="library.dynam.html">library.dynam.unload</a></code>.
This is needed for system housekeeping.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>
<code>is.loaded</code> requires the name you would give to <code>.C</code> etc
and <STRONG>not</STRONG> (as in S) that remapped by defunct functions
<code>symbol.C</code> or <code>symbol.For</code>.
</p>
<p>
The creation of DLLs and the runtime linking of them into executing
programs is very platform dependent.  In recent years there has been
some simplification in the process because the C subroutine call
<code>dlopen</code> has become the POSIX standard for doing this. Under
Unix-alikes <code>dyn.load</code> uses the <code>dlopen</code> mechanism and
should work on all platforms which support it.  On Windows it uses the
standard mechanism (<code>LoadLibrary</code>) for loading DLLs.
</p>
<p>
The original code for loading DLLs in Unix-alikes was provided by
Heiner Schwarte.
