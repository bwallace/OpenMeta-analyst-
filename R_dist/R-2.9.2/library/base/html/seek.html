<h2>Functions to Reposition Connections</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Functions to re-position connections.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
seek(con, ...)
## S3 method for class 'connection':
seek(con, where = NA, origin = "start", rw = "", ...)

isSeekable(con)

truncate(con, ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>con</code></td>
<td>
a connection.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>where</code></td>
<td>
numeric.  A file position (relative to the origin
specified by <code>origin</code>), or <code>NA</code>.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>rw</code></td>
<td>
character.  Empty or <code>"read"</code> or <code>"write"</code>,
partial matches allowed.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>origin</code></td>
<td>
character.  One of <code>"start"</code>, <code>"current"</code>,
<code>"end"</code>: see &lsquo;Details&rsquo;.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
further arguments passed to or from other methods.</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
<code>seek</code> with <code>where = NA</code> returns the current byte offset
of a connection (from the beginning), and with a non-missing <code>where</code>
argument the connection is re-positioned (if possible) to the
specified position. <code>isSeekable</code> returns whether the connection
in principle supports <code>seek</code>: currently only (possibly
gz-compressed) file connections do.  <code>gzfile</code> connections do not
support <code>origin = "end"</code>; the file position they use is that
of the uncompressed file.
</p>
<p>
<code>where</code> is stored as a real but should represent an integer:
non-integer values are likely to be truncated.  Note that the possible
values can exceed the largest representable number in an <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>
<code>integer</code> on 64-bit OSes, and on some 32-bit OSes.
</p>
<p>
Clipboard connections can seek too.
</p>
<p>
We have found so many errors in the Windows implementation of file
positioning that users are advised to use it only at their own risk,
and asked not to waste the <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> developers' time with bug reports on Windows'
deficiencies.
</p>
<p>
File connections can be open for both writing/appending, in which case
<font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> keeps separate positions for reading and writing.  Which <code>seek</code>
refers to can be set by its <code>rw</code> argument: the default is the
last mode (reading or writing) which was used.  Most files are
only opened for reading or writing and so default to that state.  If a
file is open for both reading and writing but has not been used, the
default is to give the reading position (0).
</p>
<p>
The initial file position for reading is always at the beginning.
The initial position for writing is at the beginning of the file
for modes <code>"r+"</code> and <code>"r+b"</code>, otherwise at the end of the
file.  Some platforms only allow writing at the end of the file in
the append modes.  (The reported write position for a file opened in
an append mode will typically be unreliable until the file has been
written to.)
</p>
<p>
If <code>seek</code> is called with a non-<code>NA</code> value of <code>where</code>,
any pushback on a text-mode connection is discarded.
</p>
<p>
<code>truncate</code> truncates a file opened for writing at its current
position.  It works only for <code>file</code> connections, and is not
implemented on all platforms: on others (including Windows) it will
not work for large (&gt; 2Gb) files.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
<code>seek</code> returns the current position (before any move), as a
(numeric) byte offset from the origin, if relevant, or <code>0</code> if
not.  Note that the position can exceed the largest representable
number in an <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> <code>integer</code> on 64-bit OSes, and on some 32-bit
OSes.
<br>
<code>truncate</code> returns <code>NULL</code>: it stops with an error if
it fails (or is not implemented).
<br>
<code>isSeekable</code> returns a logical value, whether the connection
supports <code>seek</code>.</p>
