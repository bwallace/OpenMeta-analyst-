<h2>Loading and Listing of Packages</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
<code>library</code> and <code>require</code> load add-on packages.
</p>
<p>
<code>.First.lib</code> is called when a package is loaded;
<code>.Last.lib</code> is called when a package is detached.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
library(package, help, pos = 2, lib.loc = NULL,
        character.only = FALSE, logical.return = FALSE,
        warn.conflicts = TRUE,
        keep.source = getOption("keep.source.pkgs"),
        verbose = getOption("verbose"))

require(package, lib.loc = NULL, quietly = FALSE,
        warn.conflicts = TRUE,
        keep.source = getOption("keep.source.pkgs"),
        character.only = FALSE, save = TRUE)

.First.lib(libname, pkgname)
.Last.lib(libpath)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>package, help</code></td>
<td>
the name of a package, given as a <a href="name.html">name</a> or
literal character string, or a character string, depending on
whether <code>character.only</code> is <code>FALSE</code> (default) or
<code>TRUE</code>).</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pos</code></td>
<td>
the position on the search list at which to attach the
loaded package.  Note that <code>.First.lib</code> may attach other
packages, and <code>pos</code> is computed <EM>after</EM> <code>.First.lib</code>
has been run.  Can also be the name of a position on the current
search list as given by <code><a href="search.html">search</a>()</code>.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>lib.loc</code></td>
<td>
a character vector describing the location of <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>
library trees to search through, or <code>NULL</code>.  The default value
of <code>NULL</code> corresponds to all libraries currently known.
Non-existent library trees are silently ignored.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>character.only</code></td>
<td>
a logical indicating whether <code>package</code> or
<code>help</code> can be assumed to be character strings.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>logical.return</code></td>
<td>
logical.  If it is <code>TRUE</code>,  <code>FALSE</code> or
<code>TRUE</code> is returned to indicate success.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>warn.conflicts</code></td>
<td>
logical.  If <code>TRUE</code>, warnings are
printed about <code><a href="conflicts.html">conflicts</a></code> from attaching the new
package, unless that package contains an object
<code>.conflicts.OK</code>.  A conflict is a function masking a function,
or a non-function masking a non-function.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>keep.source</code></td>
<td>
logical.  If <code>TRUE</code>, functions
&lsquo;keep their source&rsquo; including comments, see argument
<code>keep.source</code> to <code><a href="options.html">options</a></code>.  This applies only to
the named package, and not to any packages or name spaces which might be
loaded to satisfy dependencies or imports.
<br>
This argument does not apply to packages using lazy-loading.
Whether they have kept source is determined when they are installed
(and is most likely false).
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
a logical.  If <code>TRUE</code>, additional diagnostics are
printed.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>quietly</code></td>
<td>
a logical.  If <code>TRUE</code>, no message confirming
package loading is printed.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>save</code></td>
<td>
logical or environment.  If <code>TRUE</code>, a call to
<code>require</code> from the source for a package will save the name of
the required package in the variable <code>".required"</code>, allowing
function <code><a href="detach.html">detach</a></code> to warn if a required package is
detached. See section &lsquo;Packages that require other packages&rsquo; below.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>libname</code></td>
<td>
a character string giving the library directory where
the package was found.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pkgname</code></td>
<td>
a character string giving the name of the package.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>libpath</code></td>
<td>
a character string giving the complete path to the
package.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
<code>library(package)</code> and <code>require(package)</code> both load the
package with name <code>package</code>.  <code>require</code> is designed for use
inside other functions; it returns <code>FALSE</code> and gives a warning
(rather than an error as <code>library()</code> does by default) if the
package does not exist.  Both functions check and update the list of
currently loaded packages and do not reload a package which is already
loaded.  (Furthermore, if the package has a name space and a name
space of that name is already loaded, they work from the existing
name space rather than reloading from the file system.  If you want to
reload a package, call <code><a href="detach.html">detach</a></code> or
<code><a href="ns-load.html">unloadNamespace</a></code> first.)
</p>
<p>
To suppress messages during the loading of packages use
<code><a href="message.html">suppressPackageStartupMessages</a></code>: this will suppress all
messages from <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> itself but not necessarily all those from package
authors.
</p>
<p>
If <code>library</code> is called with no <code>package</code> or <code>help</code>
argument, it lists all available packages in the libraries specified
by <code>lib.loc</code>, and returns the corresponding information in an
object of class <code>"libraryIQR"</code>.  The structure of this class may
change in future versions.  In earlier versions of <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>, only the names
of all available packages were returned; use <code>.packages(all =
    TRUE)</code> for obtaining these.  Note that
<code><a href="../../utils/html/installed.packages.html">installed.packages</a>()</code>
returns even more information.
</p>
<p>
<code>library(help = somename)</code> computes basic information about the
package <code>somename</code>, and returns this in an object of class
<code>"packageInfo"</code>.  The structure of this class may change in
future versions.  When used with the default value (<code>NULL</code>) for
<code>lib.loc</code>, the loaded packages are searched before the libraries.
</p>
<p>
<code>.First.lib</code> is called when a package without a name space is
loaded by <code>library</code>.  (For packages with name spaces see
<code><a href="ns-hooks.html">.onLoad</a></code>.)  It is called with two arguments, the name of
the library directory where the package was found (i.e., the
corresponding element of <code>lib.loc</code>), and the name of the package.
It is a good place to put calls to <code><a href="library.dynam.html">library.dynam</a></code> which
are needed when loading a package into this function (don't call
<code>library.dynam</code> directly, as this will not work if the package is
not installed in a standard location).  <code>.First.lib</code> is invoked
after the search path interrogated by <code>search()</code> has been
updated, so <code>as.environment(match("package:name", search()))</code>
will return the environment in which the package is stored.  If
calling <code>.First.lib</code> gives an error the loading of the package is
abandoned, and the package will be unavailable.  Similarly, if the
option <code>".First.lib"</code> has a list element with the package's name,
this element is called in the same manner as <code>.First.lib</code> when
the package is loaded.  This mechanism allows the user to set package
&lsquo;load hooks&rsquo; in addition to startup code as provided by the
package maintainers, but <code><a href="userhooks.html">setHook</a></code> is preferred.
</p>
<p>
<code>.Last.lib</code> is called when a package is detached.  Beware
that it might be called if <code>.First.lib</code> has failed, so it
should be written defensively. (It is called within <code><a href="try.html">try</a></code>,
so errors will not stop the package being detached.)
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
Normally <code>library</code> returns (invisibly) the list of loaded
packages, but <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code> if <code>logical.return</code> is
<code>TRUE</code>.  When called as <code>library()</code> it returns an object of
class <code>"libraryIQR"</code>, and for <code>library(help=)</code>, one of
class <code>"packageInfo"</code>.
<br>
<code>require</code> returns (invisibly) a logical indicating whether the required
package is available.</p>

<h3>Packages that require other packages</h3>

<p>
<B>NB:</B> This mechanism has been almost entirely superseded by
using the <code>Depends:</code> field in the &lsquo;<span class="file">DESCRIPTION</span>&rsquo; file of a package.
</p>
<p>
The source code for a
package that requires one or more other packages should have a call
to <code>require</code>, preferably near the beginning of the source, and
of course before any code that uses functions, classes or methods
from the other package.  The default for argument <code>save</code> will
save the names of all required packages in the environment of the
new package.  The saved package names are used by
<code><a href="detach.html">detach</a></code> when a package is detached to warn if other
packages still require the to-be-detached package.  Also, if a package is
installed with saved image (see <a href="../../utils/html/INSTALL.html">INSTALL</a>), the saved package
names are used to require these packages when the new package is
attached.
</p>


<h3>Formal methods</h3>

<p>
<code>library</code> takes some further actions when package <span class="pkg">methods</span>
is attached (as it is by default).  Packages may define formal generic
functions as well as re-defining functions in other packages (notably
<span class="pkg">base</span>) to be generic, and this information is cached whenever
such a package is loaded after <span class="pkg">methods</span> and re-defined functions
(<a href="../../methods/html/implicitGeneric.html">implicit generic</a>s) are excluded from the list of conflicts.
The caching  and check for conflicts require looking for a pattern of
objects; the search may be avoided by defining an object
<code>.noGenerics</code> (with any value) in the package.  Naturally, if the
package <EM>does</EM> have any such methods, this will prevent them from
being used.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>
<code>library</code> and <code>require</code> can only load an <EM>installed</EM>
package, and this is detected by having a &lsquo;<span class="file">DESCRIPTION</span>&rsquo; file
containing a <code>Built:</code> field.
</p>
<p>
Under Unix-alikes, the code checks that the package was installed
under a similar operating system as given by <code>R.version$platform</code>
(the canonical name of the platform under which R was compiled),
provided it contains compiled code.  Packages which do not contain
compiled code can be shared between Unix-alikes, but not to other OSes
because of potential problems with line endings and OS-specific help
files.  If sub-architectures are used, the OS similarity is not
checked since the OS used to build may differ (e.g.
<code>i386-pc-linux-gnu</code> code can be built on an
<code>x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</code> OS).
</p>
<p>
The package name given to <code>library</code> and <code>require</code> must match
the name given in the package's &lsquo;<span class="file">DESCRIPTION</span>&rsquo; file exactly, even
on case-insensitive file systems such as MS Windows.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
library()                   # list all available packages
library(lib.loc = .Library) # list all packages in the default library
library(help = splines)     # documentation on package 'splines'
library(splines)            # load package 'splines'
require(splines)            # the same
search()                    # "splines", too
detach("package:splines")

# if the package name is in a character vector, use
pkg &lt;- "splines"
library(pkg, character.only = TRUE)
detach(pos = match(paste("package", pkg, sep=":"), search()))

require(pkg, character.only = TRUE)
detach(pos = match(paste("package", pkg, sep=":"), search()))

require(nonexistent)        # FALSE
## Not run: 
## Suppose a package needs to call a DLL named 'fooEXT',
## where 'EXT' is the system-specific extension.  Then you should use
.First.lib &lt;- function(lib, pkg)
  library.dynam("foo", pkg, lib)

## if you want to mask as little as possible, use
library(mypkg, pos = "package:base")
## End(Not run)</pre>
