<h2>Wildcard Expansion on File Paths</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Function to do wildcard expansion (also known as &lsquo;globbing&rsquo;) on
file paths.
</p>
<p>
Platforms are not required to support this, but all known current <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>
platforms do.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
Sys.glob(paths, dirmark = FALSE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>paths</code></td>
<td>
character vector of patterns for relative or absolute
filepaths.  Missing values will be ignored.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>dirmark</code></td>
<td>
logical: should matches to directories from patterns
that do not already end in <code>/</code>
or <code>\</code>
have a slash appended?  May not be supported on all platforms.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
The <code>glob</code> system call is not part of Windows, and we supply a
partial emulation.
</p>
<p>
Wildcards are <code>*</code> (match zero or more characters) and <code>?</code> (match
a single character).  If a filename starts with <code>.</code> this must be
matched explicitly.
</p>
<p>
In addition, <code>[</code> begins a character class.  If the first
character in <code>[...]</code> is not <code>!</code>, this is a character class
which matches a single character against any of the characters
specified.  The class cannot be empty, so <code>]</code> can be included
provided it is first.  If the first character is <code>!</code>, the
character class matches a single character which is <EM>none</EM> of the
specified characters.
</p>
<p>
Character classes can include ranges such as <code>[A-Z]</code>: include
<code>-</code> as a character by having it first or last in a class.  (In the
current implementation ranges are in numeric order of Unicode points.)
</p>
<p>
One can remove the special meaning of <code>?</code>, <code>*</code>  and
<code>[</code> by preceding them by a backslash (except within a
character class).  Note that on Windows <code>?</code> and <code>*</code> are not
valid in file names, so this is mainly for consistency with other
platforms.
</p>
<p>
File paths in Windows are interpreted with separator <code>\</code> or
<code>/</code>.  Paths with a drive but relative (such as <code>c:foo\bar</code>)
are tricky, but an attempt is made to handle them correctly.  As from
<font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> 2.9.2 an attempt is made to handle UNC paths starting with a double
backslash.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
A character vector of matched file paths.  The order is
system-specific (but in the order of the elements of <code>paths</code>):
on Windows collation is in the order of Unicode points.
<br>
Directory errors are normally ignored, so the matches are to
accessible file paths (but not necessarily accessible files).</p>

## End(Not run)</pre>
