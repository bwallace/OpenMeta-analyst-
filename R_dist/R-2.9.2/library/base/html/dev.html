<h2>Lists of Open/Active Graphics Devices</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
A pairlist of the names of open graphics devices is stored in
<code>.Devices</code>. The name of the active device (see
<code><a href="../../grDevices/html/dev.html">dev.cur</a></code>) is stored in <code>.Device</code>.  Both are symbols
and so appear in the base name space.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
<code>.Device</code> is a length-one character vector.
<br>
<code>.Devices</code> is a <a href="list.html">pairlist</a> of length-one character vectors.
The first entry is always <code>"null device"</code>, and there are as many
entries as the maximal number of graphics devices which have been
simultaneously active.  If a device has been removed, its entry will be
<code>""</code> until the device number is reused.</p>
