<h2>Writing the graph to a file in some format</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
<code>write.graph</code> is a general function for exporting
graphs to foreign file formats, however not many formats are
implemented right now.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
write.graph(graph, file, format=c("edgelist", "pajek", "ncol",
       "lgl", "graphml", "dimacs", "gml", "dot"), ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
The graph to export.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>file</code></td>
<td>
A connection or a string giving the file name to write the
graph to.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>format</code></td>
<td>
Character string giving the file format. Right now 
<code>pajek</code>, <code>graphml</code>, <code>dot</code>,
<code>gml</code>, <code>edgelist</code>, <code>lgl</code>,
<code>ncol</code> and <code>dimacs</code> are implemented. As of igraph 0.4 this
argument is case insensitive.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
The <code>edgelist</code> format is a simple text file, with one edge in a
line, the two vertex ids separated by a space character. The file is
sorted by the first and the second column. This format has no
additional arguments.
</p>
<p>
The Pajek format is a text file, see <code><a href="read.graph.html">read.graph</a></code> for
details. Appropriate vertex and edge attributes are also written to
the file. This format has no additional arguments.
</p>
<p>
The GraphML format is a flexible XML based format. See
<code><a href="read.graph.html">read.graph</a></code> for GraphML details. Vertex and edge
attributes are also written to the file. This format has no additional
arguments.
</p>
<p>
The dot format is used by the popular GraphViz program. Vertex and
edge attributes are written to the file. There are no additional
arguments for this format.
</p>
<p>
The <code>lgl</code> format is also a simple text file, this is the
format expected by the 'Large Graph Layout' layout generator software.
See <a href="read.graph.html">read.graph</a> for details.
Additional arguments:
<ul>
<dt>names</dt><dd>If you want to write symbolic vertex names instead of
vertex ids, supply the name of the vertex attribute containing the
symbolic names here. By default the &lsquo;name&rsquo; attribute is
used if there is one. Supply <code>NULL</code> if you want to use numeric 
vertex ids even if there is a &lsquo;name&rsquo; vertex attribute.</dd> 
<dt>weights</dt><dd>If you want to write edge weights to the file, supply
the name of the edge attribute here. By defaults the vertex
attribute &lsquo;weights&rsquo; are used if they are installed.
Supply <code>NULL</code> here if you want to omit the weights.</dd>
<dt>isolates</dt><dd>Logical, if <code>TRUE</code> the isolate vertices are
also written to the file, they are omitted by default.</dd>
</ul>

<p>
The <code>ncol</code> format is also used by LGL, it is a text file, see
<a href="read.graph.html">read.graph</a> for details.
Additional arguments:
<ul>
<dt>names</dt><dd>If you want to write symbolic vertex names instead of
vertex ids, supply the name of the vertex attribute containing the
symbolic names here. By default the &lsquo;name&rsquo; attribute is
used if there is one. Supply <code>NULL</code> if you want to use numeric 
vertex ids even if there is a &lsquo;name&rsquo; vertex attribute.</dd> 
<dt>weights</dt><dd>If you want to write edge weights to the file, supply
the name of the edge attribute here. By defaults the vertex
attribute &lsquo;weights&rsquo; are used if they are installed.
Supply <code>NULL</code> here if you want to omit the weights.</dd>
</ul>

<p>
The <code>dimacs</code> file format, more specifically the 
version for network flow problems, see the files at
<a href="ftp://dimacs.rutgers.edu/pub/netflow/general-info/">ftp://dimacs.rutgers.edu/pub/netflow/general-info/</a>
</p>
<p>
This is a line-oriented text file (ASCII) format. The first
character of each line defines the type of the line. If the first
character is <code>c</code> the line is a comment line and it is
ignored. There is one problem line (<code>p</code> in the file, it
must appear before any node and arc descriptor lines. The problem
line has three fields separated by spaces: the problem type
(<code>min</code>, <code>max</code> or <code>asn</code>), the
number of vertices and number of edges in the graph.
Exactly two node identification lines are expected
(<code>n</code>), one for the source, one for the target vertex.
These have two fields: the id of the vertex and the type of the
vertex, either <code>s</code> (=source) or <code>t</code>
(=target). Arc lines start with <code>a</code> and have three
fields: the source vertex, the target vertex and the edge capacity.
</p>
<p>
Vertex ids are numbered from 1.
</p>
<p>
Additional arguments:
<ul>
<dt>source</dt><dd>The id of the source vertex, if <code>NULL</code> (the
default) then it is taken from the <code>source</code> graph attribute.</dd>
<dt>target</dt><dd>The id of the target vertex, if <code>NULL</code> (the
default) then it is taken from the <code>target</code> graph attribute.</dd>
<dt>capacity</dt><dd>A numeric vector giving the edge capacities. If
<code>NULL</code> (the default) then it is taken from the
<code>capacity</code> edge attribute.</dd>
</ul>

<p>
GML is a quite general textual format, see 
<a href="http://www.infosun.fim.uni-passau.de/Graphlet/GML/">http://www.infosun.fim.uni-passau.de/Graphlet/GML/</a> for details.
</p>
<p>
The graph, vertex and edges attributes are written to the
file as well, if they are numeric of string.
</p>
<p>
As igraph is more forgiving about attribute names, it might 
be neccessary to simplify the them before writing to the GML file.
This way we'll have a syntactically correct GML file. The following 
simple procedure is performed on each attribute name: first the alphanumeric 
characters are extracted, the others are ignored. Then if the first character
is not a letter then the attribute name is prefixed with &lt;quote&gt;igraph&lt;/quote&gt;.
Note that this might result identical names for two attributes, igraph 
does not check this. 
</p>
<p>
The &ldquo;id&rdquo; vertex attribute is treated specially. 
If the <code>id</code> argument is not <code>NULL</code> then it should be a numeric 
vector with the vertex ids and the &ldquo;id&rdquo; vertex attribute is 
ignored (if there is one). If <code>id</code> is 0 and there is a 
numeric <code>id</code> vertex attribute that is used instead. If ids
are not specified in either way then the regular igraph vertex ids are used.
</p>
<p>
Note that whichever way vertex ids are specified, their 
uniqueness is not checked.
</p>
<p>
If the graph has edge attributes named &ldquo;source&rdquo;
or &ldquo;target&rdquo; they're silently ignored. GML uses these attributes
to specify the edges, so we cannot write them to the file. Rename them 
before calling this function if you want to preserve them.
</p>
<p>
Additional arguments:
<ul>
<dt>id</dt><dd><code>NULL</code> or a numeric vector giving the vertex ids. See
details above.</dd>
<dt>creator</dt><dd>A character scalar to be added to the
&ldquo;Creator&rdquo; line in the GML file. If this is <code>NULL</code> (the
default) then the current date and time is added.</dd>
</ul>
