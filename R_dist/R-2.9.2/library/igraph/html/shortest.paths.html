<h2>Shortest (directed or undirected) paths between vertices</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
<code>shortest.paths</code> calculates the length of all the
shortest paths from or to the vertices in the
network. <code>get.shortest.paths</code> calculates one shortest path (the
path itself, and not just its length) from or to the given vertex.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
shortest.paths(graph, v=V(graph), mode = c("all", "out", "in"),
      weights = NULL, algorithm = c("automatic", "unweighted",
                                    "dijkstra", "bellman-ford",
                                    "johnson"))
get.shortest.paths(graph, from, to=V(graph), mode = c("all", "out",
      "in"), weights = NULL)
get.all.shortest.paths(graph, from, to = V(graph), mode = c("all", "out", "in")) 
average.path.length(graph, directed=TRUE, unconnected=TRUE)
path.length.hist (graph, directed = TRUE, verbose = igraph.par("verbose")) 
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
The graph to work on.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>v</code></td>
<td>
Numeric vector, the vertices from or to which the shortest
paths will be calculated.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>mode</code></td>
<td>
Character constant, gives whether the shortest paths to or
from the given vertices should be calculated for directed graphs. If
<code>out</code> then the shortest paths <EM>from</EM> the vertex, if
<code>in</code> then <EM>to</EM> it will be considered. If <code>all</code>, the
default, then the corresponding undirected graph will be used,
ie. not directed paths are searched. This argument is ignored for
undirected graphs.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>weights</code></td>
<td>
Possibly a numeric vector giving edge weights. If this
is <code>NULL</code> and the graph has a <code>weight</code> edge attribute,
then the attribute is used. If this is <code>NA</code> then no weights are
used (even if the graph has a <code>weight</code> attribute).</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>algorithm</code></td>
<td>
Which algorithm to use for the calculation. By
default igraph tries to select the fastest suitable algorithm. If
there are no weights, then an unweighted breadth-first search is used,
otherwise if all weights are positive, then Dijkstra's algorithm is
used. If there are negative weights and we do the calculation for
more than 100 sources, then Johnson's algorithm is used. Otherwise
the Bellman-Ford algorithm is used. You can override igraph's choice
by explicitly giving this parameter. Note that the igraph C core
might still override your choice in obvious cases, i.e. if there are
no edge weights, then the unweighted algorithm will be used,
regardless of this argument.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>from</code></td>
<td>
Numeric constant, the vertex from or to the shortest paths
will be calculated. Note that right now this is not a vector of
vertex ids, but only a single vertex.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>to</code></td>
<td>
Numeric vector, only the shortest paths to these vertices
will be calculated. Defaults to all vertices.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>directed</code></td>
<td>
Whether to consider directed paths in directed graphs,
this argument is ignored for undirected graphs.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>unconnected</code></td>
<td>
What to do if the graph is unconnected (not
strongly connected if directed paths are considered). If TRUE only
the lengths of the existing paths are considered and averaged; if
FALSE the length of the missing paths are counted having length
<code>vcount(graph)</code>, one longer than the longest possible geodesic
in the network.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
Logical scalar, whether to draw a progress meter while
the calculation is running.</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
The shortest paths (also called geodesics) are calculated by
using breath-first search in the graph. If no edge weights were
specified, then a breadth-first search is used to calculate the
shortest paths. If edge weigths are given and all of them are
non-zero, then Dijkstra's algorithm is used. Otherwise the
Bellman-Ford algorithm is used for <code>shortest.paths</code>.
</p>
<p>
Please do NOT call <code>get.shortest.paths</code> and
<code>get.all.shortest.paths</code> with negative edge weights, it will not
work, these functions do not use the Belmann-Ford algotithm.
</p>
<p>
Note that <code>shortest.paths</code> is able to calculate the path length
from or to many vertices at the same time, but
<code>get.shortest.paths</code> works from one source only. This might
change in the future.
</p>
<p>
Also note that <code>get.shortest.paths</code> gives only one shortest path,
however, more than one might exist between two vertices.
</p>
<p>
<code>get.all.shortest.paths</code> calculates all shortest paths from a
vertex to other vertices given in the <code>to</code> argument.
</p>
<p>
<code>path.length.hist</code> calculates a histogram, by calculating the
shortest path length between each pair of vertices. For directed
graphs both directions are considered, so every pair of vertices
appears twice in the histogram.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
For <code>shortest.paths</code> a numeric matrix with <code>vcount(graph)</code>
columns and <code>length(v)</code> rows. The shortest path length from a vertex to
itself is always zero. For unreachable vertices <code>Inf</code> is included.
<br>
For <code>get.shortest.paths</code> a list of length
<code>vcount(graph)</code>. List element <code>i</code> contains the vertex ids on
the path from vertex <code>from</code> to vertex <code>i</code> (or the other way
for directed graphs depending on the <code>mode</code> argument). The vector
also contains <code>from</code> and <code>i</code> as the first and last
elements. If <code>from</code> is the same as <code>i</code> then it is only
included once. If there is no path between two vertices then a
numeric vector of length zero is returned as the list element.
<br>
For <code>get.all.shortest.paths</code> a list is returned, each list
element contains a shortest path from <code>from</code> to a vertex in
<code>to</code>. The shortest paths to the same vertex are collected into
consecutive elements of the list.
<br>
For <code>average.path.length</code> a single number is returned.
<br>
<code>path.length.hist</code> returns a named list with two entries:
<code>res</code> is a numeric vector, the histogram of distances,
<code>unconnected</code> is a numeric scalar, the number of pairs for which
the first vertex is not reachable from the second. The sum of the two
entries is always <i>n(n-1)</i> for directed graphs and <i>n(n-1)/2</i>
for undirected graphs.</p>
