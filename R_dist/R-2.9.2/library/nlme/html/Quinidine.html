<h2>Quinidine Kinetics</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
The <code>Quinidine</code> data frame has 1471 rows and 14 columns.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>
This data frame contains the following columns:
<dl>
<dt>Subject</dt><dd>a factor identifying the patient on whom the data were collected.
</dd>
<dt>time</dt><dd>a numeric vector giving the time (hr) at which the drug was
administered or the blood sample drawn.  This is measured
from the time the patient entered the study.
</dd>
<dt>conc</dt><dd>a numeric vector giving the serum quinidine concentration (mg/L).
</dd>
<dt>dose</dt><dd>a numeric vector giving the dose of drug administered (mg).
Although there were two different forms of quinidine
administered, the doses were adjusted for differences in
salt content by conversion to milligrams of quinidine base.
</dd>
<dt>interval</dt><dd>a numeric vector giving the when the drug has been given at
regular intervals for a sufficiently long period of time to
assume steady state behavior, the interval is recorded.
</dd>
<dt>Age</dt><dd>a numeric vector giving the age of the subject on entry to
the study (yr).
</dd>
<dt>Height</dt><dd>a numeric vector giving the height of the subject on entry
to the study (in.).
</dd>
<dt>Weight</dt><dd>a numeric vector giving the body weight of the subject (kg).
</dd>
<dt>Race</dt><dd>a factor with levels
<code>Caucasian</code>, 
<code>Latin</code>, and
<code>Black</code> identifying the race of the subject.
</dd>
<dt>Smoke</dt><dd>a factor with levels
<code>no</code> and
<code>yes</code> giving smoking status at the time of the
measurement.
</dd>
<dt>Ethanol</dt><dd>a factor with levels
<code>none</code>, 
<code>current</code>,
<code>former</code> giving ethanol (alcohol) abuse status at the
time of the measurement.
</dd>
<dt>Heart</dt><dd>a factor with levels
<code>No/Mild</code>, 
<code>Moderate</code>, and 
<code>Severe</code> indicating congestive heart failure for the subject.
</dd>
<dt>Creatinine</dt><dd>an ordered factor with levels
<code>&lt; 50</code> &lt; <code>&gt;= 50</code> indicating the creatine clearance (mg/min).
</dd>
<dt>glyco</dt><dd>a numeric vector giving the alpha-1 acid glycoprotein
concentration (mg/dL).  Often measured at the same time as
the quinidine concentration.
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
Verme et al. (1992) analyze routine clinical data on
patients receiving the drug quinidine as a treatment for cardiac
arrythmia (atrial fibrillation of ventricular arrythmias).  All
patients were receiving oral quinidine doses.  At irregular intervals
blood samples were drawn and serum concentrations of quinidine were
determined.  These data are
analyzed in several publications, including Davidian and Giltinan (1995,
section 9.3).
