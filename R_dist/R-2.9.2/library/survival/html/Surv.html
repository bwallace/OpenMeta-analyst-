<h2>Create a Survival Object</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Create a survival object, usually used as a response variable in a model 
formula. Argument matching is special for this function, see Details below.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
Surv(time, time2, event,
    type=c('right', 'left', 'interval', 'counting', 'interval2'),
    origin=0)
is.Surv(x)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>time</code></td>
<td>
for right censored data, this is the follow up time.  For interval
data, the first argument is the starting time for the interval. 
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>event</code></td>
<td>
The status indicator, normally 0=alive, 1=dead.  Other choices are
<code>TRUE</code>/<code>FALSE</code> (<code>TRUE</code> = death) or 1/2 (2=death). For
interval censored data, the status indicator is 0=right censored,
1=event at <code>time</code>, 2=left censored, 3=interval censored.
Although unusual, the event indicator can be omitted, in which case
all subjects are assumed to have an event.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>time2</code></td>
<td>
ending time of the interval for interval censored  or counting
process data only.  Intervals are assumed to be open on the left and
closed on the right, <code>(start, end]</code>.  For counting process
data, <code>event</code> indicates whether an event occurred at the end of
the interval.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
character string specifying the type of censoring. Possible values
are <code>"right"</code>, <code>"left"</code>, <code>"counting"</code>,
<code>"interval"</code>, or <code>"interval2"</code>.  The default is
<code>"right"</code> or <code>"counting"</code> depending on whether the
<code>time2</code> argument is absent or present, respectively.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>origin</code></td>
<td>
for counting process data, the hazard function origin.  This option
was intended to be used in conjunction with a model containing
time dependent
strata in order to align the subjects properly when they cross over
from one strata to another, but it has rarely proven useful.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
any R object.
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
Typical usages are
<pre>
Surv(time, event)
Surv(time, time2, event, type= )
</pre>
The <code>time</code>,<code>time2</code> and <code>event</code> arguments are matched by
position, not by name, so use, eg, <code>Surv(time, dead)</code> rather than
<code>Surv(time, event=dead)</code>
</p>
<p>
In theory it is possible to represent interval censored data without a 
third column containing the explicit status.  Exact, right censored, 
left censored and interval censored observation would be represented as 
intervals of [a,a], (a, infinity), (-infinity,b), and [a,b]  
respectively; each interval is a pair of time points 
within which the event is  
known to have occurred. 
</p>
<p>
If <code>type="interval2"</code> then the representation given above is 
assumed, with <code>NA</code> taking the place of infinity.  
If <code>type="interval"</code> then <code>event</code> must be given.  
If <code>event</code> is <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, or <code>2</code>, 
the relevant 
information is assumed to be contained in <code>time</code>,
the value in <code>time2</code> is ignored,
and the second column of the internal representation contains a 
placeholder value.
</p>
<p>
Presently, the only methods allowing interval censored data are the 
parametric models computed by <code>survreg</code> and survival curves
computed by <code>survfit</code>; for both of these, 
the distinction between open and closed intervals
is unimportant.  
The distinction is important for counting process data and 
the Cox model. 
</p>
<p>
The function tries to distinguish between the use of 0/1 and 1/2 coding for 
left and right censored data using 
<code>if (max(status)==2)</code>. 
If 1/2 coding is used and all the subjects are censored, it will 
guess wrong.
In any questionable case it is safer to use logical coding,
e.g., <code>Surv(time, status==3)</code> would indicate that a <code>3</code> is
the code for an event.
</p>
<p>
Surv objects can be subscripted either as an object, e.g.
<code>x[1:3]</code> using a single subscript;
in which case the <code>drop</code> argument is ignored;
or as a matrix, using two arguments.
If the second subscript is missing and <code>drop=F</code>
(the default),
the result of the subscripting will be a Surv object, e.g., 
<code>x[1:3,,drop=F]</code>,
otherwise the result will be a matrix (or vector), in accordance with
the default behavior for subscripting matrices.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
An object of class <code>Surv</code>.  There are methods for <code>print</code>,
<code>is.na</code>, and subscripting survival objects.   <code>Surv</code> objects
are implemented as a matrix of 2 or 3 columns.
<br>
In the case of <code>is.Surv</code>, a logical value <code>TRUE</code> if <code>x</code>
inherits from class <code>"Surv"</code>, otherwise an <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
