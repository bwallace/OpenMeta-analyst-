<h2>Fix Objects Saved from R Versions Previous to 1.8</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Beginning with R version 1.8.0, the class of an object contains the
identification of the package in which the class is defined.  The
function <code>fixPre1.8</code> fixes and re-assigns objects missing that information
(typically because they were loaded from a file saved with a previous
version of R.)
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
fixPre1.8(names, where)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>names</code></td>
<td>
Character vector of the names of all the objects to be
fixed and re-assigned.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>where</code></td>
<td>
The environment from which to look for the objects, and
for class definitions.  Defaults to the top environment of the
call to <code>fixPre1.8</code>, the global environment if the function
is used interactively.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
The named object will be saved where it was found.  Its class
attribute will be changed to the full form required by R 1.8;
otherwise, the contents of the object should be unchanged.
</p>
<p>
Objects will be fixed and re-assigned only if all the following
conditions hold:
<ol>
<li>The named object exists.
<li>It is from a defined class (not a basic datatype which
has no actual class attribute).
<li>The object appears to be from an earlier version of R.
<li>The class is currently defined.
<li>The object is consistent with the current class definition.
</ol>
<p>
If any condition except the second fails, a warning message is
generated.
</p>
<p>
Note that <code>fixPre1.8</code> currently fixes <EM>only</EM> the change in
class attributes.  In particular, it will not fix binary versions of
packages installed with earlier versions of R if these use
incompatible features.  Such packages must be re-installed from
source, which is the wise approach always when major version changes
occur in R.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
The names of all the objects that were in fact re-assigned.</p>
