<h2>Car Speeding and Warning Signs</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
The <code>amis</code> data frame has 8437 rows and 4 columns.
</p>
<p>
In a study into the effect that warning signs have on speeding patterns, 
Cambridgeshire County Council considered 14 pairs of locations.
The locations were paired to account for factors such as traffic volume
and type of road.  One site in each pair had a sign erected warning of the
dangers of speeding and asking drivers to slow down.  No action was taken at
the second site.  Three sets of measurements were taken at each site.  Each set
of measurements was nominally of the speeds of 100 cars but not all sites have
exactly 100 measurements. These speed measurements were taken before the 
erection of the sign, shortly after the erection of the sign, and again after 
the sign had been in place for some time.
