     'Cairo' initializes a new graphics device that uses the cairo
     graphics library for rendering. The current implementation
     produces high-quality PNG, JPEG, TIFF bitmap files, high
     resolution PDF files with embedded fonts, SVG graphics and
     PostScript files. It also provides X11 and Windows interactive
     graphics devices. Unlike other devices it supports all graphics
     features including alpha blending, anti-aliasing etc.

     'CairoX11', 'CairoPNG', 'CairoPDF', 'CairoPS' and 'CairoSVG' are
     convenience wrappers of 'Cairo' that take the same arguments as
     the corresponding device it replaces such as 'X11', 'png', 'pdf',
     etc. Use of the 'Cairo' function is encouraged as it is more
     flexible than the wrappers.

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   width: width of the plot area (also see 'units').

  height: height of the plot area (also see 'units').

    file: name of the file to be created or connection to write to.
          Only PDF, PS and PNG types support connections. For X11 type
          'file' specifies the display name. If 'NULL' or '""' a
          reasonable default will be chosen which is '"plot.type"' for
          file-oriented types and value of the 'DISPLAY' environment
          variable for X11. For image types the file name can contain
          printf-style formatting expecting one integer parameter which
          is the page number, such as '"Rplot%03d.png"'. The page
          numbers start at one.

    type: output type. This version of Cario supports "png", "jpeg" and
          "tiff" bitmaps (png/tiff with transparent background), "pdf"
          PDF-file with embedded fonts, "svg" SVG-file, "ps"
          PostScript-file, "x11" X11 interactive window and "win"
          Windows graphics. Depending on the support of various
          backends in cairo graphics some of the options may not be
          available for your system. See 'Cairo.capabilities' function.

pointsize: initial text size (in points).

  canvas: canvas color (must be opaque). The canvas is only used by
          devices that display graphics on a screen and the canvas is
          only visible only if bg is transparent.

      bg: plot background color (can include alpha-component or be
          transparent alltogether).

   units: units for of the 'width' and 'height' specifications. It can
          be any of '"px"' (pixels), '"in"' (inches), '"pt"' (points),
          '"cm"' (centimeters) or '"mm"' (millimeters).

     dpi: DPI used for the conversion of units to pixels. If set to
          '"auto"' the DPI resolution will be determined by the
          back-end.

     ...: additional backend specific parameters (e.g. 'quality'
          setting for JPEG (0..100) and 'compression' for TIFF
          (0,1=none, 5=LZW (default), 7=JPEG, 8=Adobe Deflate))   

          All parameters listed below are defined by the other devices
          are are used by the wrappers to make it easier replace other
          devices by 'Cairo'. They are described in detail in the
          documentation corresponding to the device that is being
          replaced.

 display: X11 display, see 'X11'

   gamma: gamma correction

    xpos: see 'X11'

    ypos: see 'X11'

filename: same as 'file' in 'Cairo'

     res: see 'png', will be mapped to 'dpi' for 'Cairo'

 quality: quality of the jpeg, see 'jpeg'

 onefile: logical: if true (the default) allow multiple figures in one
          file (see 'pdf'). false is currently not supported by vector
          devices

  family: font family, see 'pdf'

   title: see 'pdf' (ignored)

   fonts: see 'pdf', ignored, 'Cairo' automatically detects and embeds
          fonts

 version: PDF version, see 'pdf' (ignored)

   paper: see 'pdf' (ignored, 'Cairo' uses device dimensions)

encoding: see 'pdf' (ignored, 'Cairo' uses native enconding except for
          symbols)

      fg: see 'pdf' (ignored)

pagecentre: see 'pdf' (ignored, 'Cairo' uses device dimensions and thus
          it is irrelevant)

  record: see 'windows' (ignored)

 rescale: see 'windows' (ignored)

  xpinch: see 'windows' (ignored)

  ypinch: see 'windows' (ignored)

buffered: see 'windows' (ignored, 'Cairo' always uses cache buffer)

restoreConsole: see 'windows' (ignored)

horizontal: see 'postscript' (ignored)

print.it: see 'postscript' (ignored)

 command: see 'postscript' (ignored)

colormodel: see 'postscript' (ignored, 'Cairo' always uses 'RGB' or
          'ARGB')

_V_a_l_u_e:

     The (invisible) return value is NULL if the device couldn't be
     created or a 'Cairo' object if successful. The vaule of the object
     is the device number.

        *  The X11 backend is quite slow. The reason is the
           cairographics implementation of the backend, so we can't do
           much about it. It should be possible to drop cairographics'
           Xlib backend entirely and use image backend copied into an
           X11 window instead. We may try that in future releases.

        *  TrueType (and OpenType) fonts are supported when this
           package is compiled against a cairo graphics library
           configured with FreeType and Fontconfig support. Therefore
           make sure have a cairo grpahics library with all bell and
           whistles to get a good result.

        *  R math symbols are supported, but require a TrueType
           "Symbol" font accessible to Cairo under that name.
