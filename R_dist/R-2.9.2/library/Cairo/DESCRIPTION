Description: This package provides a Cairo graphics device that can be
        use to create high-quality vector (PDF, PostScript and SVG) and
        bitmap output (PNG,JPEG,TIFF), and high-quality rendering in
        displays (X11 and Win32). Since it uses the same back-end for
        all output, copying across formats is WYSIWYG. Files are
        created without the dependence on X11 or other external
        programs. This device supports alpha channel (semi-transparent
        drawing) and resulting images can contain transparent and
        semi-transparent regions. It is ideal for use in server
        environemnts (file output) and as a replacement for other
        devices that don't have Cairo's capabilities such as alpha
        support or anti-aliasing. Backends are modular such that any
        subset of backends is supported.
