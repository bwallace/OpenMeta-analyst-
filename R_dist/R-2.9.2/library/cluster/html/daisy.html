<h2>Dissimilarity Matrix Calculation</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Compute all the pairwise dissimilarities (distances) between observations
in the data set.  The original variables may be of mixed types.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
daisy(x, metric = c("euclidean", "manhattan", "gower"),
      stand = FALSE, type = list())
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
numeric matrix or data frame.  Dissimilarities will be computed
between the rows of <code>x</code>.  Columns of mode <code>numeric</code>
(i.e. all columns when <code>x</code> is a matrix) will be recognized as
interval scaled variables, columns of class <code>factor</code> will be
recognized as nominal variables, and columns of class <code>ordered</code>
will be recognized as ordinal variables.  Other variable types
should be specified with the <code>type</code> argument.  Missing values
(<code><a href="../../base/html/NA.html">NA</a></code>s) are allowed.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>metric</code></td>
<td>
character string specifying the metric to be used.
The currently available options are <code>"euclidean"</code> (the default),
<code>"manhattan"</code> and <code>"gower"</code>.<br>
Euclidean distances are root sum-of-squares of differences, and
manhattan distances are the sum of absolute differences.
<br>
&ldquo;Gower's distance&rdquo; is chosen by metric <code>"gower"</code>
or automatically if some columns of <code>x</code> are not numeric. Also
known as Gower's coefficient (1971),
expressed as a dissimilarity, this implies that a particular
standardisation will be applied to each variable, and the
&ldquo;distance&rdquo; between two units is the sum of all the
variable-specific distances, see the details section.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>stand</code></td>
<td>
logical flag: if TRUE, then the measurements in <code>x</code>
are standardized before calculating the
dissimilarities.  Measurements are standardized for each variable
(column), by subtracting the variable's mean value and dividing by
the variable's mean absolute deviation.
<br>
If not all columns of <code>x</code> are numeric, <code>stand</code> will
be ignored and Gower's standardization (based on the
<code><a href="../../base/html/range.html">range</a></code>) will be applied in any case, see argument
<code>metric</code>, above, and the details section.
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
list for specifying some (or all) of the types of the
variables (columns) in <code>x</code>.  The list may contain the following
components: <code>"ordratio"</code> (ratio scaled variables to be treated as
ordinal variables), <code>"logratio"</code> (ratio scaled variables that
must be logarithmically transformed), <code>"asymm"</code> (asymmetric
binary) and <code>"symm"</code> (symmetric binary variables).  Each
component's value is a vector, containing the names or the numbers
of the corresponding columns of <code>x</code>.
Variables not mentioned in the <code>type</code> list are interpreted as
usual (see argument <code>x</code>).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
<code>daisy</code> is fully described in chapter 1 of Kaufman and Rousseeuw (1990).
Compared to <code><a href="../../stats/html/dist.html">dist</a></code> whose input must be numeric
variables, the main feature of <code>daisy</code> is its ability to handle
other variable types as well (e.g. nominal, ordinal, (a)symmetric
binary) even when different types occur in the same data set.
</p>
<p>
The handling of nominal, ordinal, and (a)symmetric binary data is
achieved by using the general dissimilarity coefficient of Gower
(1971).  If <code>x</code> contains any columns of these
data-types, both arguments <code>metric</code> and <code>stand</code> will be
ignored and Gower's coefficient will be used as the metric.  This can
also be activated for purely numeric data by <code>metric = "gower"</code>.
With that, each variable (column) is first standardized by dividing
each entry by the range of the corresponding variable.
</p>
<p>
Note that setting the type to <code>symm</code> (symmetric binary) gives the
same dissimilarities as using <EM>nominal</EM> (which is chosen for
non-ordered factors) only when no missing values are present, and more
efficiently.
</p>
<p>
Note that <code>daisy</code> now gives a warning when 2-valued numerical
variables don't have an explicit <code>type</code> specified, because the
reference authors recommend to consider using <code>"asymm"</code>.
</p>
<p>
In the <code>daisy</code> algorithm, missing values in a row of x are not
included in the dissimilarities involving that row.  There are two
main cases,
<ol>
<li>If all variables are interval scaled,
the metric is "euclidean", and ng is the number of columns in which
neither row i and j have NAs, then the dissimilarity d(i,j) returned is
sqrt(ncol(x)/ng) times the Euclidean distance between the two vectors
of length ng shortened to exclude NAs.  The rule is similar for the
"manhattan" metric, except that the coefficient is ncol(x)/ng.
If ng is zero, the dissimilarity is NA.
<li>When some variables have a type other than interval scaled, the
dissimilarity between two rows is the weighted sum of the contributions of
each variable.<br>
The weight becomes zero when that variable is missing in either or both
rows, or when the variable is asymmetric binary and both values are
zero.  In all other situations, the weight of the variable is 1.
</p>
<p>
The contribution of a nominal or binary variable to the total
dissimilarity is 0 if both values are equal, 1 otherwise.  The
contribution of other variables is the absolute difference of both
values, divided by the total range of that variable.  Ordinal
variables are first converted to ranks.
</p>
<p>
If <code>nok</code> is the number of nonzero weights, the dissimilarity is
multiplied by the factor <code>1/nok</code> and thus ranges between 0 and 1.
If <code>nok = 0</code>, the dissimilarity is set to <code><a href="../../base/html/NA.html">NA</a></code>.
</ol>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
an object of class <code>"dissimilarity"</code> containing the
dissimilarities among the rows of <code>x</code>.  This is typically the
input for the functions <code>pam</code>, <code>fanny</code>, <code>agnes</code> or
<code>diana</code>.  For more details, see <code><a href="dissimilarity.object.html">dissimilarity.object</a></code>.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>
Dissimilarities are used as inputs to cluster analysis and
multidimensional scaling.  The choice of metric may have a
large impact.

<h3>Examples</h3>

##  Dissimilarities using Euclidean metric and without standardization
d.agr &lt;- daisy(agriculture, metric = "euclidean", stand = FALSE)
d.agr
as.matrix(d.agr)[,"DK"] # via as.matrix.dist(.)

## Example 2 in ref
summary(dfl1 &lt;- daisy(flower, type = list(asymm = 3)))
summary(dfl2 &lt;- daisy(flower, type = list(asymm = c(1, 3), ordratio = 7)))
## this failed earlier:

        type = list(asymm = c("V1", "V3"), symm= 2,
                    ordratio= 7, logratio= 8)))
