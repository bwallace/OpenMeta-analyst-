<h2>Accessing Auxiliary Information During Plotting</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Control over lattice plots are provided through a collection of user
specifiable functions that perform various tasks during the plotting.
Not all information is available to all functions.  The functions
documented here attempt to provide a consistent interface to access
relevant information from within these user specified functions,
namely those specified as the <code>panel</code>, <code>strip</code> and
<code>axis</code> functions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>

current.row()
current.column()
panel.number()
packet.number()
which.packet()

trellis.currentLayout(which = c("packet", "panel"))

</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>which</code></td>
<td>
whether return value (a matrix) should contain panel numbers or
packet numbers, which are usually, but not necessarily, the same
(see below for details).
</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
<code>trellis.currentLayout</code> returns a matrix with as many rows and
columns as in the layout of panels in the current plot.  Entries in
the matrix are integer indices indicating which packet (or panel; see
below) occupies that position, with 0 indicating the absence of a
panel.  <code>current.row</code> and <code>current.column</code> return integer
indices specifying which row and column in the layout are currently
active.  <code>panel.number</code> returns an integer counting which panel
is being drawn (starting from 1 for the first panel, a.k.a. the panel
order).  <code>packet.number</code> gives the packet number according to the
packet order, which is determined by varying the first conditioning
variable the fastest, then the second, and so on.  <code>which.packet</code>
returns the combination of levels of the conditioning variables in the
form of a numeric vector as long as the number of conditioning
variables, with each element an integer indexing the levels of the
corresponding variable.</p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>
The availability of these functions make redundant some features
available in earlier versions of lattice, namely optional arguments
called <code>panel.number</code> and <code>packet.number</code> that were made
available to <code>panel</code> and <code>strip</code>.  If you have written such
functions, it should be enough to replace instances of
<code>panel.number</code> and <code>packet.number</code> by the corresponding
function calls.  You should also remove <code>panel.number</code> and
<code>packet.number</code> from the argument list of your function to avoid
a warning.
</p>
<p>
If these accessor functions are not enough for your needs, feel free
to contact the maintainer and ask for more.
