<h2>Description of Terms Objects</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
An object of class <code><a href="terms.html">terms</a></code> holds information about a
model.  Usually the model was specified in terms of a
<code><a href="formula.html">formula</a></code> and that formula was used to determine the terms
object.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
The object itself is simply the formula supplied to the call of
<code><a href="terms.formula.html">terms.formula</a></code>.  The object has a number of attributes
and they are used to construct the model frame:
</p>
<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>factors</code></td>
<td>
A matrix of variables by terms showing which variables
appear in which terms.  The entries are 0 if the variable does not
occur in the term, 1 if it does occur and should be coded by
contrasts, and 2 if it occurs and should be coded via dummy
variables for all levels (as when an intercept or lower-order term
is missing).  If there are no terms other than an intercept and offsets,
this is <code>numeric(0)</code>.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>term.labels</code></td>
<td>
A character vector containing the labels for each
of the terms in the model, except for offsets.  Non-syntactic names
will be quoted by backticks.  Note that these are after possible
re-ordering (unless argument <code>keep.order</code> was false).</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>variables</code></td>
<td>
A call to <code>list</code> of the variables in the model.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>intercept</code></td>
<td>
Either 0, indicating no intercept is to be fit, or 1
indicating that an intercept is to be fit.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>order</code></td>
<td>
A vector of the same length as <code>term.labels</code>
indicating the order of interaction for each term.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>response</code></td>
<td>
The index of the variable (in variables) of the
response (the left hand side of the formula). Zero, if there is no
response.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>offset</code></td>
<td>
If the model contains <code><a href="offset.html">offset</a></code> terms there
is an <code>offset</code> attribute indicating which variable(s) are offsets</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>specials</code></td>
<td>
If a <code>specials</code> argument was given to
<code><a href="terms.formula.html">terms.formula</a></code> there is a <code>specials</code> attribute, a
list of vectors (one for each specified special function) giving
numeric indices of the arguments of the list returned as the
<code>variables</code> attribute which contain these special functions.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>dataClasses</code></td>
<td>
optional. A named character vector giving the classes
(as given by <code><a href="checkMFClasses.html">.MFclass</a></code>) of the variables used in a fit.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>

<br>
The object has class <code>c("terms", "formula")</code>.</p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>
These objects are different from those found in S.  In particular
there is no <code>formula</code> attribute, instead the object is itself a
formula.  Thus, the mode of a terms object is different as well. 
</p>
<p>
Examples of the <code>specials</code> argument can be seen in the
<code><a href="aov.html">aov</a></code> and <code><a href="../../survival/html/coxph.html">coxph</a></code> functions.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
## use of specials (as used for gam() in packages mgcv and gam)
(tf &lt;- terms(y ~ x + x:z + s(x), specials = "s"))
## Note that the "factors" attribute has variables as row names
## and term labels as column names, both as character vectors. 
attr(tf, "specials")    # index 's' variable(s)
rownames(attr(tf, "factors"))[attr(tf, "specials")$s]

## we can keep the order by
terms(y ~ x + x:z + s(x), specials = "s", keep.order = TRUE)
