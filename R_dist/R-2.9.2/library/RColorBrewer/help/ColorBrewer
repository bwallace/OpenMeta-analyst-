       n: Number of different colors in the palette, minimum 3, maximum
          depending on palette

    type: One of the string "div", "qual", "seq", or "all" 

  select: A list of names of existing palettes

 exact.n: If TRUE, only display palettes with a color number given by n

     'brewer.pal' makes the color palettes from ColorBrewer available
     as R palettes.

     'display.brewer.pal' displays the selected palette in a graphics
     window.

     'display.brewer.all' displays the a few palettes simultanueously
     in a graphics window.

     'brewer.all.info' returns information about the available palettes
     as a dataframe.

     For details and an interactive palette selection tools see
     http://colorbrewer.org. It is free to use, although ColorBrewer's
     designers would appreciate it if you could cite the ColorBrewer
     project  if you decide to use one of our color schemes.

     There are 3 types of palettes, sequential, diverging, and
     qualitative.

      1. Sequential palettes are suited to ordered data that progress
     from low to high.  Lightness steps dominate the look of these
     schemes, with light colors for low data values  to dark colors for
     high data values.  
      2. Diverging palettes put equal emphasis on mid-range critical
     values and extremes at both ends  of the data range. The critical
     class or break in the middle of the legend is emphasized  with
     light colors and low and high extremes are emphasized with dark
     colors that have  contrasting hues.  
      3. Qualitative palettes do not imply magnitude differences
     between legend classes,  and hues are used to create the primary
     visual differences between classes.  Qualitative schemes are best
     suited to representing nominal or categorical data.

     The sequential palettes names are 
      Blues BuGn BuPu GnBu Greens Greys Oranges OrRd PuBu PuBuGn     
     PuRd Purples RdPu Reds YlGn YlGnBu YlOrBr YlOrRd

     All the sequential palettes are available in variations from 3
     different values up to 9 different values.

     The diverging palettes are 
      BrBG PiYG PRGn PuOr RdBu RdGy RdYlBu RdYlGn Spectral

     All the diverging palettes are available in variations from 3
     different values up to 11 different values.

     For qualitative palettes, the lowest number of distinct values
     available always is 3, but the largest number is different for
     different palettes. It is given together with the palette names in
     the following table.

       Accent    8
       Dark2     8
       Paired   12
       Pastel1   9
       Pastel2   8
       Set1      9
       Set2      8
       Set3     12

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A palette 
      You will get an error when you ask for a nonexisting palette, and
     you will get a warning if a palette you asked for exists but not
     with as many different leves as you asked for.
