     Moving (aka running, rolling) Window's Standard Deviation 
     calculated over a vector

_U_s_a_g_e:

       runsd(x, k, center = runmean(x,k), 
                      endrule=c("sd", "NA", "trim", "keep", "constant", "func"))

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: numeric vector of length n

       k: width of moving window; must be an integer between one and n.
          In case of even k's one will have to provide different
          'center' function, since 'runmed' does not take even k's.

 endrule: character string indicating how the values at the beginning 
          and the end, of the data, should be treated. Only first and
          last 'k2'  values at both ends are affected, where 'k2' is
          the half-bandwidth  'k2 = k %/% 2'.

             *  '"mad"' - applies the mad function to smaller and
                smaller sections of the array. Equivalent to:  'for(i
                in 1:k2) out[i]=mad(x[1:(i+k2)])'. 

             *  '"trim"' - trim the ends; output array length is equal
                to  'length(x)-2*k2 (out = out[(k2+1):(n-k2)])'. This
                option mimics  output of 'apply' '(embed(x,k),1,FUN)'
                and other  related functions.

             *  '"keep"' - fill the ends with numbers from 'x' vector 
                '(out[1:k2] = x[1:k2])'. This option makes more sense
                in case of  smoothing functions, kept here for
                consistency.

             *  '"constant"' - fill the ends with first and last
                calculated  value in output array '(out[1:k2] =
                out[k2+1])'

             *  '"NA"' - fill the ends with NA's '(out[1:k2] = NA)'

             *  '"func"' - same as '"mad"' option except that
                implemented in R for testing purposes. Avoid since it
                can be very slow for large windows.

          Similar to 'endrule' in 'runmed' function which has the 
          following options: “'c("median", "keep", "constant")'” . 

  center: moving window center. Defaults  to running mean ('runmean'
          function). Similar to 'center'   in 'mad' function. 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Apart from the end values, the result of y = runmad(x, k) is the
     same as  “'for(j=(1+k2):(n-k2)) y[j]=sd(x[(j-k2):(j+k2)], na.rm =
     TRUE)'”. It can handle  non-finite numbers like NaN's and Inf's
     (like 'mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)').

     The main incentive to write this set of functions was relative
     slowness of  majority of moving window functions available in R
     and its packages.  With the  exception of 'runmed', a running
     window median function, all  functions listed in "see also"
     section are slower than very inefficient 
     “'apply(embed(x,k),1,FUN)'” approach.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     Returns a numeric vector of the same length as 'x'. Only in case
     of  'endrule="trim"'.the output will be shorter.

        *  'runsd' - 'sd', 'rollVar' from  'fSeries' library

        *  Other moving window functions  from this package: 'runmin', 
           'runmax', 'runquantile', 'runmad' and 'runmean' 

        *  generic running window functions: 'apply'' (embed(x,k), 1,
           FUN)' (fastest), 'rollFun'  from 'fSeries' (slow), 'running'
           from 'gtools'  package (extremely slow for this purpose),
           'rapply' from  'zoo' library, 'subsums' from  'magic'
           library can perform running window operations on data with
           any  dimensions.
