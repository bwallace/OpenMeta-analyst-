_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Functions for performing basic sum operations without round-off
     errors

_U_s_a_g_e:

       sum.exact(..., na.rm = FALSE)
       cumsum.exact(x)
       runsum.exact(x,k)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: numeric vector

     ...: numeric vector(s), numbers or other objects to be summed

   na.rm: logical. Should missing values be removed?

       k: width of moving window; must be an odd integer between one
          and n 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     All three functions use full precision summation using multiple
     doubles for  intermediate values. The sum of numbers x & y is
     a=x+y with error term  b=error(a+b). That way a+b is equal exactly
     x+y, so sum of 2 numbers is stored as 2 or fewer values, which
     when added would under-flow. By extension sum of n  numbers is
     calculated with intermediate results stored as array of numbers 
     that can not be added without introducing an error. Only final
     result is  converted to a single number

_V_a_l_u_e:

     Function 'sum.exact' returns single number. Function
     'cumsum.exact'  returns vector of the same length as 'x'. Function
     'runsum.exact'  returns vector of length 'length(x)-k' and
     attribute "count" containing number of finite (as in 'is.finite')
     elements in each window.

     Jarek Tuszynski (SAIC) jaroslaw.w.tuszynski@saic.com based on code
     by Vadim Ogranovich, which is based on algorithms described in 
     references, pointed out by Gabor Grothendieck.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:


        *  'sum' is faster but not error-save version of  'sum.exact'

        *  'cumsum' is equivalent to 'cumsum.exact'

        *  'runmean(x,k,endrule="trim")' is similar to  'runsum.exact'.
