Description: jjplot is a plotting library inspired by ggplot2.  jjplot
        is written in grid and while not yet as functional as ggplot2,
        jjplot can quickly and easily produce beautiful graphics
        including line graphs, scatter plots, bar graphs, and boxplots.
        jjplot also makes it straightfoward to compute and overlay
        statistics and fits onto graphs, and to facet graphs by factor
        via subplots and automatic color scales.
